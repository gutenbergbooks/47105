<h2>Preface.</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/il-p-v.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">Another</span> trifling instalment towards the history of
Worcestershire is now respectfully presented to its
inhabitants, and the Author ventures to express a hope
that it may meet with the general favour of the reading
public, equal to that which his previous works have
elicited.</p>

<p>The materials of historical works usually consist of tables
of pedigrees, charters, battles, sieges, enumerations of
manors, with their successive owners, statistical details, and
other tedious though useful information. These, however,
are but the dry bones&mdash;the skeleton of history. The
spirit of the past can only be evoked by a deep and
extensive research among documentary and traditional
evidences&mdash;by careful comparison and analysis&mdash;by judicious
deduction and inference. To perform this effectually,
even for the limited area of a county, the co&ouml;peration
of many minds is almost indispensable. Let us take Worcestershire
as an instance. Habingdon, Nash, Thomas,
Green, and others, have accumulated large masses of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
matter which conventionally passes for history, and I would
not for one moment desire to detract from the merit of
their labours: yet the history of Worcestershire remains to
be written. What do we yet know of the manners and
customs, the hopes and aspirations, the social every-day
life, the habits and thoughts, of our ancestors? Yet surely
this is not the least considerable feature of the times of
which we would fain glean tidings. Who would not vastly
prefer an hour or two's conversation with one who was in
the flesh some centuries ago&mdash;could that be possible&mdash;to
studying the pages of the most intelligent contemporaneous
historian? Education had rendered the world dissatisfied
with the old modes and precise forms of this department
of literature, when such pens as Macaulay's were soon ready
to supply the new want. Yet Macaulay could have done
but little service in this way had he been content to receive
old stereotyped facts which had for centuries been lazily
copied by preceding writers. It was by industriously and
perseveringly investigating public and private libraries, hunting
up all available resources, and systematically comparing
and arranging the information thus obtained, that he was
enabled, by the potency of his genius, to erect on a new
foundation a superstructure that has delighted and astonished
all beholders. That great man's industry, at all events, if
not his genius, may, and must be, imitated by all who would
successfully labour in the field of history for the future.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
The annals of even so circumscribed an area as a county
must not be written without at least searching the records
of its principal courts of judicature, nor that of a city before
consulting the dusty relics in the parochial chests and the
municipal closets. Yet these fertile sources of authentic
information have been almost entirely neglected by Worcestershire
historians. The Author of this little work has made
a commencement, humble though it be, towards furnishing
data for the required undertaking; yet how much remains
to be done! Nor can a single individual, confined to the
requirements of an absorbing profession, be expected, alone
and unaided, to achieve much. If some one in each parish
would undertake to search the register, the old vestry and
churchwardens' books, and any manuscripts or other material
that may exist in the parish; if others would investigate
the archives of the municipal towns, the Assize records
(which I presume are in the possession of Mr. Wilde, at
Clifford's Inn), the MSS. and rare books which may be
found in the libraries of private gentlemen and the British
Museum, and, though last, the most important of all, the
ancient ecclesiastical registers and other records in Edgar
Tower&mdash;the labour of a life&mdash;some material would then be
gleaned from which a competent editor might produce a
history worthy of the county&mdash;a picture of the life and
manners of our ancestors, and not a mere record of names
and dates and crude undigested facts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span></p>

<p>The fragments which the Author has rescued from the accumulating
dust of past ages are here presented, in the hope
that others more competent will be stimulated to similar
exertions in the various departments above indicated. Two
insuperable reasons prevent his undertaking the task himself&mdash;first,
that it would prove overwhelming and impossible to
one who can spare only an occasional hour for the purpose,
while, if divided amongst many, the accomplishment would
be easy; and secondly, that much of the work to be
done&mdash;especially the examination of ancient ecclesiastical
documents&mdash;requires far greater scholastic attainments
and a more intimate knowledge of the middle ages than
he possesses. "Divide and conquer" must be the motto,
if the work is to be done.</p>

<p>Meanwhile it will be noted with satisfaction that every
successive exploration into the past indicates more distinctly
the decided progress we have made, and exposes the fallacy
of the belief in the "good old times:"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The good of ancient times let others state:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I think it fortunate we're born so late."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the few sheets here collected, evidence is given of civil
and religious strife, such as we are now happily exempt
from; of coarse habits, and a reckless expenditure of public
funds on gross sensuality; the primitive state of the highways
and the miserable travelling consequent thereon; the infancy
of science in almost every department, and the greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
prevalence of disease; superstition pervading all classes;
women flogged in public, and the gaol a very specimen of
barbarism; the poor hunted out of their cottages in every
parish like wild beasts, and nearly all descriptions of trade
fettered by absurd restrictions; nonconformity persecuted,
and constitutional liberty, as we now understand the term,
unknown. Nor were the manners and customs of our
ancestors much more desirable than our own, although there
was a greater heartiness in them and apparently a more
general mixing of classes. When Parry was searching for
the north-west passage, a boat was one day sent on shore,
under charge of a petty officer, who received, besides
the usual instructions to keep a look-out for anything
remarkable, a printed form, on which, under the heads
of "Manners," and "Customs," to record what he saw
among the natives. In due time the boat returned to the
ship, the man delivered in his report; and an extraordinary
one it was for pith and brevity, running thus:</p>

<table border="0" class="tdl" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="report">
<tr>
  <td class="br"><span class="smcap">Manners</span></td>
  <td><span class="smcap">Customs</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="br">None at all.</td>
  <td>Very beastly.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>That the same report might have been truthfully applied
even to English society in the last and preceding centuries
the following pages prove, and still more conclusively might
the charge have been brought home had the author felt
himself justified in printing <i>in extenso</i> some of the documents
he has consulted, especially among the county rolls.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
Let us, however, not quarrel with our predecessors, but
rightfully appreciate the blessings of advanced civilization
by endeavouring, each one in his limited sphere, to
inculcate contentment with our lot and an earnest
desire to assist in the great work of human progress,
both physical and moral.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the Author begs to offer his warm thanks
to the patrons of this book (individually named in the dedication),
without whose kind promises of support the work
would not have been published; to Sir T. E. Winnington,
Bart., M.P., for the inspection of many interesting manuscripts;
to the clergy and churchwardens of the city, for
their courtesy in permitting the examination of the registers
and other parish books; to Mr. Carrington, barrister-at-law,
for several valuable contributions and highly prized literary
assistance; to Mr. Lewis, of the County Clerk of the Peace's
office, for the trouble he so willingly incurred in displacing
and re-arranging the Sessions' rolls; and lastly, to the general
body of subscribers, who have so numerously signified their
intention to take copies.</p>

<h2>PARISH RECORDS<br />

OF<br />

THE CITY OF WORCESTER.</h2>


<h3>St. Michael's.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/il-p001.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> register of this parish commences with the year
1546, but as the entries for about half a century are
apparently in the same handwriting, it is probable
that in or soon after the year 1597, when an order was issued
that all parochial registers should be transcribed on vellum,
an older register of St. Michael's was copied on that now
existing. It is on vellum and in excellent preservation&mdash;which
probably will not be said some two or three centuries hence
respecting the common and perishable paper registers now
in use by Government authority. The first entry which
attracted my attention in this register was&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"1648.&mdash;John Somers, gent., and Katherine, the daughter of John
Seaverne, gent., and Mary his wife, were married Nov. 13."</p>

<p>And among the births are the following:</p>

<p>"1650.&mdash;John the sonne of John Somers, gent., and Katherine his
wife, was born the fourth day of March."</p>

<p>"1653.&mdash;Mary, daughter of John Somers, gent., and Katherine his
wife, was born 15th Oct."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>"1655.&mdash;Katherine, daughter of John Somers, gent., and Katherine
his wife, born 7th April."</p></div>

<p>Here, then, are the means of deciding a fact which has long
been the subject of dispute. Mr. Cooksey, in his "Life of
Lord Somers," asserts that he was born at the White Ladies;
but Dr. Nash mentions the tradition that the famous Lord
was born in the College Churchyard, in a house since pulled
down, adjoining the south side of the old church of St.
Michael; "but as during the Civil Wars (says that veracious
and <i>painstaking</i> chronicler, Chambers) the registers were
discontinued, or very irregularly kept, <i>though the Doctor
diligently searched, his birth could not be found</i>, either in the
parishes of Severn Stoke, St. Michael, St. Helen, St. Peter,
or the Tything." The "diligence" of the Doctor's search
must now be a matter of doubt, as the four entries copied
above are not only easily observed, but are somewhat prominent.
The "John Somers, gent.," whose marriage with
Katherine Seaverne is recorded in 1648, was unquestionably
the attorney who resided for some time at the White Ladies,
and afterwards within the Cathedral precincts; and their
first-born, who was introduced to the world on the 4th of
March, 1650, was afterwards the celebrated nobleman who
became the head of the Whigs and Lord High Chancellor
of England&mdash;whose eloquence, knowledge of the law, inflexible
integrity, and great capacity for public business, made him an
ornament to his country&mdash;and whose defence of the seven
bishops, in opposition to the tyranny of James II, entitles
him to a place in the foremost rank of the defenders of our
constitutional liberty. The death of his parents is not
entered in St. Michael's register, as they both died and were
buried at Severn Stoke. Lord Somers himself was buried
in Hertfordshire.</p>

<p>The period of the Civil Wars is distinguished by blank pages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
but regularity again commences in 1660. The burial of "Sir
Gilbert Jerrard, governor of Woster," is recorded on the
20th of January, 1644; and that of John Cox, master of the
College school, on the 30th Dec., 1663. The prisoners and
debtors who died in the Castle (the old prison stood on the site
of the Castle, near the Cathedral, now converted into gardens)
were buried at St. Michael's. It appears likewise that St.
Michael's was considered the parish church for the whole of
the College precincts, and that if any marriages were performed
at the Cathedral, they were duly entered in St. Michael's
register, and the incumbent of course received the fees.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Mr. Richard Smith, minister, and Mrs. Anne Foulks, were
marryed in ye Cathedrall on ye 13 day Feby., 1676."</p>

<p>"Jonathan Dixon of Kidderminster and Mary Henzey of this
parish were married at the College by me, Oct. 7, 1737, by license.
Thomas Smith."</p></div>

<p>An archdeacon was also married in the chapel of the Bishop's
Palace at Worcester, and an entry in this register duly
records the fact. Marriages were solemnized here between
persons belonging to almost every town or place in the county,
and entries of those occurrences are more numerous than in
any other register of the city. The list of marriages closes
with this note:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"See a marriage register book from the year 1754, in pursuance of
an Act of Parliament passed in the 26th year of King George III,
which restriction commences from the 25th March, 1754."</p></div>

<p>In the birth department the children of dissenters were for
some years put under a separate head, and specified as such,
and there are frequent records of "children left," and
"children picked up" in the parish. Lastly, there is mention
made of Henry Humphreys having, by will in 1729, left &pound;4
yearly to the incumbent of St. Michael's and &pound;1 to the clerk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
on condition they take care that his grave shall not be opened
or touched except for the burial of his wife. This money was
payable out of "a freehold messuage or tenement, lands, and
premises in the parish of Kington, Worcestershire;" but the
bequest has long been lost sight of and the estate is not
known; there is, however, no doubt that the identification of
the estate might be readily made out if its present owners
were inclined to do justice to the claims of the church.
Perhaps a former owner compounded with the then incumbent
for a sum of money or other consideration.</p>

<p>By far the most interesting and valuable of all the parochial
records in the city are those of St. Michael's, the oldest
account book going back to the year 1543, and, with the
exception of from 1611 to 1640, which years are omitted, the
records come up to the present century. As these books take
us back to a period before the completion of the Reformation,
they contain evidence of religious ceremony and social custom
which entitle them to the first place in this work. Among the
ceremonials of the unreformed Church, the most conspicuous
was that at Easter, when the Resurrection was represented.
For this purpose a tomb or sepulchre was arranged in the
chancel (a recess still to be seen in the chancel wall of most
old churches), in which the effigy of the Saviour was laid, and
watched day and night by persons appointed for the purpose,
as well as by religious devotees, till it was raised out of the tomb
on the morning of Easter Sunday, when the previous darkness
in the church suddenly ceased, and a flood of light, together
with the richest music, incense, and every sign of rejoicing,
celebrated the event. In St. Michael's church, the clerk was
paid 2d. (worth 2s. 6d. now) for watching on Easter eve, and
also was presented with a pair of gloves. "Tacketts (small
nails), pynnes, and thrydde, to dresse the sepulchre," were
charged 2d., and 4d. for the labour of dressing, great pains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
having evidently been taken. Arras tapestry hangings or
curtains were provided for the tomb, large wax lights and
flowers were arranged on the altars (of which there were three
in St. Michael's church), and the rood, which was a carved
representation of the Crucifixion, elevated on the chancel arch,
was also splendidly lit up and decorated with flowers, as were
the niches containing figures of the saints. Oil, frankincense,
and robes, are charged for in the accounts, the lighting of the
rood and sepulchre amounting to as much as 7s. 1d.; for
making 25 lbs. of wax, 12d., and for flowers for the tapers and
rood light, 2d. A taper was also fixed over the font. The
celebration of this festival did not terminate with the church,
as the wardens on the same day (Easter Sunday, 1543) spent
the sum of 3d. at the tavern. There is likewise an entry of
2d. paid for "nayles and pynnes for the sepulter on Palme
Sunday, and wyer for the curteynes for the sepulter at Ester."
The following obsequies were observed at St. Michael's church
on the death of Henry VIII:</p>

<p>The progress of the Reformation during the reign of
Edward VI is distinctly marked in these records, by the mode
in which the churchwardens were compelled to set their house
in order. A man named John Davyes was employed to
"hewe downe the seates of the images in the church and to
whytelyme it," for which he received 15d.; "an ares cov'yng<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
(arras covering) wh. was used at the sepulter" was sold to
Mr. Bland for 6s. 8d.; the lamp and censer, weighing 20 lb.,
for 4s.; "two standerdes of brasse, two cansticks, and a tynacle
of brasse for holly (holy) water, weying 3 lb.," 14s.; "a coppe
crosst," (the priest's cope, with a cross on it) 2s.; a platter,
18d.; "a holy water pott of led, and certein organne pypes of
led, weying half C. and 12 lb.," 2s. 10d.; for "13 lb. of pewter
of organne pypes and shelles for tapers, at 2d. a lb.," 2s. 2d.;
two small bells were sold for 9d.; the top of the pulpit went
for 2s., and the foot for 2d.; the organs, the "fayle and old
clothes to cover the saynts," the tables that stood on each of
the altars, the "trymmer" of the high altar, the altars themselves,
and all the other appointments, disappeared like useless
lumber. Two inventories of the church goods were written
out for the commissioners, and the churchwardens and their
friends made merry on the occasion at the tavern. Instead of
the gorgeous altars, two "frames," or trestles (or "oyster
boards," as the Bishop of Exeter would term them), were
provided for the Lord's Supper; and in lieu of carved saints
and mural emblazonments, a man was engaged to "write the
Scriptures and paint the church at 2d. the yard," on those
parts of it, at least, where the whitewasher's brush had not
taken the precedence. In the fifth year of King Edward, the
old churchwardens handed over to the new ones the church
goods, of which the following is an inventory:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"A chalice, two pattens, the cover of a pyx, foot of a silver
cross, a crucifix that was on the cover of the pyx, a little silver bowl,
the little bowl of the pyx that the crucifix stood on, six pieces of
silver and gylte, and a little image of St. Michael of silver gylt, a
little bell without a clapp., two brasen canstycks, two painted clothes,
a pawle of silk, two sirplices for children, two aubs (albs), a table
cloth, five towels, the parson's sirplice and the clarks sirplice, a course
pawle, and bere cloth."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>Under the reign of Mary, old customs were partly revived,
as charges were again made for the pascal taper, wax, frankincense,
and charcoal in Lent; Mr. Blunt's man was remunerated
"for his paines when he sett the cross and the rest of
the stuffe;" Father Charlemayne was paid 6d. for mending
the crysmatory; 7d. was charged for chains for the censer;
"Raffe Pynner" mended the pyx; and apparently the high
altar was reinstated, for after the death of her Majesty, 6d.
was paid for taking down the altar, and 3s. "for paving the
place and making clean of it." The parish went to but small
expense in solemnising Queen Mary's death, 9d. only having
been spent "for quene majesty's obit." The Paraphrases of
Erasmus had been previously purchased at a cost of 11s., and,
with a Bible in English, chained to a lectern. The rood loft
was now pulled down, and sold as old timber for 3s. This was
in 1561, at which time another inventory of the church goods
was furnished, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"A processional, the portuas in two parts for the whole year, a
missal, a manual, a book for christening and burying, a pall lyned,
and a old pall onlyned, an old vestment of silk, a front of an alter
of red and white satten, with flourdelich (<i>fleur de lis</i>), two albes,
two surplices for childern, a little pillow of green, two towels with
blew thredd, a bible, a book of comon &mdash;&mdash;, six stoles for the
neck and arm, a book of the paraphrasis, two parelles for albes, a
lamp, and certaine pieces of an old lamp, two iron roddes with
stockynns upon them, and two curteins of red and yellow, the
pastall tapur and eight endes of other tapurs, the sepultre without
a hedd, a cross cloth of green silk, a corp &mdash;&mdash; case, a chalis and
patten, two table cloths, two surplises for men, one old cloth to
cover the com'n bord."</p></div>

<p>A "cupp and pott for the com'n bord" was purchased in
1566 at a cost of 3s., and 6d. for the carriage of it from
London. The "frame where our little bell hanged"&mdash;probably
the sanctus bell&mdash;was taken down in 1580. Fifteen years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
later, Nicholas Archbold, the churchwarden, chargeth himself
with 7s. 9d. "received from Fowlke Broughton for the old
bible of the church, and also with 12d., which this accountant,
before the sale thereof, received of one Mr. Morrys, a relator
to the Council in the Marches of Wales, in earnest of the said
bible, which 12d. was forfeited by him, for that he fetcht not
the book as he p'mised." Mr. Morris, no doubt, was more
punctual in his subsequent dealings with churchwardens.
The old communion book was also disposed of for 3s. 4d.;
but "a newe fayer Englishe bible of the last translacon
authorised in the church" was purchased for 16s., and a new
communion book for 6s. 8d.</p>

<p>Sittings in the church were paid for yearly, at the rate of
from 4d. to 6d. each. In 1567, a Mr. Doctor gave 5s. for a
seat "which the parishioners promised should remain to his
house for ever." Also, in the same year, "received of Mrs.
Bland for the seat that her husband paid for her frendes to
knele in, 12d.;" and the keeper of the Castle (then the county
gaol) paid the like sum for himself and wife. A Mr. Richard
Jones was paid 3s. 4d. for preaching two sermons on Palm
Sunday in the year 1624; but the usual mode of paying
ministers who did not belong to the parish when they
preached was by treating them with a quart of sack, claret,
or other wine. The Bishop sometimes preached here; and
on one occasion the vestry treated his lordship to a rundlett
of sack, costing &pound;1. 10s. 10d., besides a quart of sack and a
quart of white wine&mdash;the rundlett probably for the use of the
numerous suite which bishops in those days always brought
in their train, and the other for his lordship's own dinner
table on the day that he honoured St. Michael's pulpit. On
the same occasion a silk girdle, costing 8s., was given to
Mr. Parr, one of the Bishop's chaplains, for preaching twice.
The number of needy and itinerant preachers in the seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>teenth
century must have been considerable, judging from
the frequent relief allowed them. Probably one of these is
referred to in the following curious entry:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Given to one that come with Tres patents out of Turkie, that had
bin long in prison for the maintenance of the ghospel, vi<i>d</i>."</p></div>

<p>Muscadell was used for the communion wine. At Christmas
the church was decked with rosemary and bays, sometimes
with ivy and holly. A curious illustration of the poorness of
the living occurs in these books. It seems that about the year
1551, the living, which was a peculiar, in the gift of the Dean
and Chapter, lapsed to the Crown, and has so continued ever
since, it not being worth while to pay the expense of the seals,
&amp;c., on account of the smallness of the rectory. The custom,
therefore, was for the parishioners to make a present of 40s.
annually to the parson&mdash;a sum equivalent to &pound;20 of present
money. In addition to which, in the year 1627, their benevolence
expanded into the donation of a suit of clothes to his
reverence, Mr. Hoskins. For this purpose they purchased,
"by general consent," five yards of "russett kersey," three
yards of white cotton, half an ell of "russett bayes," an ell
and quarter of linen cloth, three dozen buttons, and silk, also
a sheepskin to make him pockets; all of which, including the
making, cost &pound;1. 5s. A yearly pension was also paid by the
church of Worcester (the Cathedral) to one Roger Follyott, for
the use of the parson of St. Michael's, but about the year 1590
the said Roger fell into arrears; a great controversy arose,
which was settled by the Dean ordering him to pay 50s. to the
churchwardens. Much care seems to have been taken of the
parish records, and in 1630 a memorandum specifies that "the
church and parish evidences and writings were removed forth
of the old chest, and brought and put into the new frame of
cubbords or boxes by the feoffees of the lands belonging to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
church and parish, and by the churchwardens and divers
others of the ancient and better rank of the parish, on Sunday,
Nov. 5," and five keys were distributed amongst them with
abundant precaution. The period was approaching in which
all their care and solicitude were necessary. The first indication
of the troublous period of the Civil Wars was the outlay of
12d. for a book of "prayers for the Parliament for a fast."
Then, in 1642 (the year of the siege of Worcester), on the 24th
of September, being the day when the Earl of Essex took
possession of the city, after defeating the Princes Rupert and
Maurice, and driving them, together with Lord Coventry, Sir
William Russell, and their forces, over the bridge towards
Herefordshire, a general pillage ensued, but the churchwardens
of St. Michael's apparently compromised the matter by "giving
to captains and soldiers for preserving our church goods and
writings," 10s. 4d. Widow Ward's chimney, however, was
broken down by the soldiers, and its reparation cost 12d.</p>

<p>The "coming of the princes" had been welcomed by a
plentiful ringing of the bells of St. Michael's, but "Colonel
Essex" was treated to a pottle of white wine and sugar at
the Talbot. The jumbling together of incidents at this period
is amusing, for about the same time the sum of half-a-crown
was spent upon a Mr. Hackett, "in wine, beare, and tobacko,
he reading prayers and preaching with us;" also 17s. "for
a musket and bandeleer for the parish use, by command of
the Governor and Commissioners, remaining with Abraham
Pilkington, trained souldier for the parish." Providing one
soldier seems to have been the fixed requirement for this
parish, as in 1560 a charge of 3s. 2d. was made "for settyng
forthe of a man in the warres to Berwick." The second
siege of Worcester was in 1646, but the only allusion to
military matters in that year are the donations of 5s. to "a
soldier's wife delivered of a child in the Dark Alley, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
husband having gone from her;" and 6d. "given in charity
to one goodwife Packman, a very pore woman, whose husband
was killed at Stowe fight, and she beinge at old Gyles his
house in the Colledge, and in great miserie, was recommended
by Mr. Moore, one of the committee." The year 1651, when
Cromwell's crowning victory put the loyal city of Worcester
to so much trouble, left numerous traces of the event in the
books of this parish. After an inventory of the church plate
and furniture then in their possession, the churchwardens say
that "All the rest of the parish goods were plundered by
Generall Cromwell's souldiers after the routinge of the Scotish
army at Worcester ye 4th September last, viz., one flaggon,
a pewter pott of three pints, one carpet of stript stuffe, half
silk, being the gift of Richard Wannerton, one fayre carpet
of branched green velvet, frindged about with deep green
frindge, being the gift of Nicholas Archbold, gent., one holland
table cloth for the comm'n table, one covering of fine holland
to lay over the cushion upon the com'n table, with buttons
at the four corners thereof, one table napkin of holland for
the com'n board, two old velvet cushions." It seems that
shortly after this sanguinary struggle, a County Session
was held at Droitwich, and the sum of &pound;500 was granted for
the relief of the poor of Worcester, so much impoverished in
the war. St. Michael's churchwardens acknowledge receiving
the tenth part of this sum; and at the same time there was
also laid out the sum of &pound;2. 9s. 4d. "for buryall of the Scots
that were slain and dyed in our parish, the Pallace, the
Colledge, the Colledge Green, Castle Hill, and ye precincts
of the said several places, and of divers others that were
brought out of ye citty of Worcester and layd in the churchyard."
From this interesting entry it is evident that large
numbers of the combatants in those eventful days are resting
beneath the sod of St. Michael's churchyard&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Their bodies dust&mdash;their good swords rust&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their souls are with the saints, we trust."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Just a century later it was ordered that for all bodies buried
in the church the sum of one guinea should be paid, and a
brick arch turned "to avoid the offensive smells which the
inhabitants too often have been annoyed with;" and in
October, 1767, appears the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Ordered, that whereas it appears to us that the sextons of the
College having unjustly received for many years past 20s. for the use
of the Rev. the Dean and Chapter, and 8s. for their trouble in
receiving the same, making in the whole &pound;1. 3s., for every person
buryed in the said parish churchyard, not being a parishioner, besides
tacking of horses, and tolerating pedlars and other strollers to sell
their ware thereon, as also in the passage leading unto the High
Street, to the great detriment of the parish and a nuisance to the
community in general, ordered that the officers of the said parish do
set forth their grievances to the Rev. Dean and Chapter, and humbly
request their assistance towards fencing the said churchyard in a
decent manner, the said parishioners having been at large expense
in repairing and beautifying the parish church, and a numerous poor
rendering them incapable of doing the whole."</p></div>

<p>About a century ago the parsonage house was ordered to be
excused from all manner of payments, upon consideration of
the minister preaching a sermon on Good Friday yearly; part
of this parsonage house was called "the coffee-house," and
was probably used for that purpose. An annual guinea was
paid to the clerk "for singing a psalm every Sunday <i>between</i>
the two services;" the same amount to Mr. Staples to act as
parish attorney to give his advice at any time; Mrs. Mary
Linton was allowed "to have the sole use of the gallery of the
church in her time, to take her scool there, on condition that
she be at the expense of a new staircase to the gallery;" and
"ordered, that the parish pump be locked down, and not to be
used (except in case of fire) without the parishioners who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
make use of it will contribute towards the late expense of the
said pump."</p>

<p>This brings us to the subject of parochial expenditure. The
first year that figures are introduced into the accounts (and
then only for the dates) was in 1557; small numerals were
used in carrying out the sums of the items until the year 1644,
when figures regularly superseded them. The churchwardens
and their friends met and drank together on Easter Day,
chiefly at the Talbot, when new churchwardens were chosen,
also at the visitation, at "beating the parish bounds," going to
inspect the parish property at Clifton, Severn Stoke, and on
many other occasions. In 1624, on account of the perambulation,
the church was dressed with boughs and rushes, by
the clerk, at a charge of 4d., and the sum of 5s. 8d. was spent
at the Talbot; the prisoners of the county gaol received 6d.
wherewith to forget their sorrows for a time, bread was given
to the poor, money to the ringers (there were three bells and
a "tinking bell" at that time); and 8d. was "paid to a bottman
for carrienge by water the minister and other of ye p'ishe
when they went the p'ambulacon round by the Castle Hill and
B'pp's Pallace." The poor had grown so numerous and
burdensome by the year 1701, that an order was made for no
officer to spend money on any of these public occasions; but
the lust of the flesh soon reassumed its ancient sway, for in the
succeeding year a meeting of twenty of the parishioners,
including most of those who had been so considerate for the
parochial purse, ordered that the old custom of spending &pound;1 at
the perambulation and election of officers should be revived.
Many other subsequent efforts at economy were made, but
without any permanent effect; and in 1778 I find that no less
than &pound;5 for processioning and 18s. for cakes, besides other
sums for various parish meetings, were allowed. The total
receipts of the parish in 1657 were &pound;56. 4s. 3d., and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
disbursements &pound;55. 2s. 9d., but of the balance in hand the
accountant observes&mdash;"in which money there was a leaden
shilling which had long been in the parish stock, and was now
broken to pieces by consent of ye parishioners." The Whitsun
farthings paid by the officials from the beginning of these
records regularly amounted to 5d. per annum. For an explanation
of this item, as also for hoseling or houseling money,
which was regularly paid, see some of the following chapters.</p>

<p>It would seem that the poor were cared for as well as the
imperfect arrangements of those days permitted. Minute
details are given of the "rigging out" of parish apprentices.
In 1623, Gervase and William Johnes, two pauper lads, were
put out, the former to Thomas Fletcher, who received &pound;1. 6s.
with him; and the latter to William Spender, who had &pound;1. 10s.;
in one case the indentures cost 4s., in the other 1s. The two
suits of apparel given to the lads were made of 8 yards of
Kidderminster stuff at 14d., 2 ells canvas to line their doublets,
2 ditto for their hosen, an ell straight lining, buttons and
thread, 6 yards cotton at 7d. for their hosen, 1&frac12; dozen points 3d.
(Query, what were these?) 6&frac34; ells "huswife's cloth to make
fower shirts" 6s. 9d., making 12d., washing old shirts 2d.,
making 2 doublets and 2 pair of hozen 5s., 2 pair of stockings
2s., 2 bands 1s., 2 hats 4s., 2 pair shoes 2s. 6d. One Stanton,
a waggoner, was paid 7s. in August, 1635, to carry a boy to
London, and 2s. more "to let the sister of the boy ride sometimes
who went along with him." On the carrier's return he
was allowed 4d., "disbursed by him for victuals." Cider was
given to Mary Lench, a poor parishioner, in 1722, "to take
two doses of physic in for the jaundice, and 6d. to let her
blood;" and subsequently, 6d. "to buy alicampane powder
and two leeches for her distemper." Mr. Sergeant Groves
was likewise treated to a shilling's worth of cider in 1707,
"when he was pleased to give his advice for the parish." In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
1726, "given to a pore widow near ye Palace, to buy a pair of
specktacles to see to work," 6d.; and "a pair of pumps for the
foundling" was on two or three occasions charged for, at 10d.
each. Did this term denote thin, light shoes? The sum of
&pound;5 was received by St. Michael's officers every Christmas
during the life of the good Bishop Hough, being their share of
&pound;100 annually devoted by his lordship to the poor of this city.
There was beside a liberal amount of charitable bequests from
property left by benevolent persons, and many small sums to
be lent for the benefit of young beginners in trade. The
parish possessed houses in St. Peter's and St. Helen's; lands
at Hanbury; Beanhall Farm, Kempsey; a small estate at
Clifton, in the parish of Severn Stoke, and some other property.
The churchwardens also regularly received a small payment
"for the Talbot passage," which was probably for a right of
way to the Talbot inn, there being a house belonging to the
parish close by the top of the Talbot entry. Considerable
litigation occurred at various periods with reference to the
parochial possessions, especially those at Severn Stoke. The
churchwardens had occasionally to ride to Bridgnorth, Ludlow,
Bewdley, and Shrewsbury, where the Council of the Marches
sat, to obtain judgment in their suits, one of which had
reference to the sale of some trees by the churchwardens.
More on the subject of the jurisdiction of that Council will be
found in the chapter on St. Andrew's. The following looks
like a case of grave suspicion, in reference to a period when
the character of judges was not like that of C&aelig;sar's wife, and
when juries of "honest and true" men did not disdain a
"refresher." Robert Walker, the churchwarden in 1573,
hands in a "reckoning" thus:</p>

<p>The clerk of the assize, the crier, and others, also had their
fees on the occasion.</p>

<p>Besides the regular yearly income of the parish, it appears
that lands were left at Synglebarrow, in the parish of Great
Horwood, Buckingham, out of which a small payment was
made (probably in rotation) to the Corporations of Worcester,
Winchester, and Reading, the towns of Calne and Aylesbury,
and the parishes of St. Michael and Great Horwood.</p>

<p>In 1779, the citizens being about to petition Parliament to
increase the powers under their act for supplying the city with
water, paving the streets, &amp;c., and having proposed to extend
the said act to the parish of St. Michael, in order to avoid
union with the city in the said act, which it was apprehended
might prove injurious to them, the several proprietors of
lands and houses situate next the city engaged voluntarily to
remove obstructions, and to pave their soils from St. Mary's
Steps to the College Gates, at their several costs, and a
committee was appointed to direct the execution thereof.</p>

<p>The only other entries remaining to be noticed are the
following curious ones:</p>

<table border="0"  class="tdl" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="other entries">

<p>What these tokens were required for at Easter I cannot
ascertain, but suppose them to have been for some religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
purpose. Tokens for change do not occur before the time of
Charles I, and they were made by tradesmen, not parishes,
and had nothing to do with Easter.</p>

<p>In the year 1660, John Martin, bell founder, was employed
in "casting and hanging the second bell." This was at the
Worcester foundry, which was in operation a few years only,
which is still called "Bellfounders' Yard," Silver Street.
Lastly, in 1769, one of the vestry meetings was attended (or
at least the minutes are signed by) seven women and seven
men. This introduction of the feminine element, however,
seems to have been a very rare exception to the rule in those
days.</p>

<p>The present rector of St. Michael's is the Rev. George
St. John; churchwardens, Mr. Henry Bennett and Mr. Curtis.
Population in 1851, 483. The office of clerk has been in the
family of Bond for nearly a century; and the records state
that, in 1763, Nathaniel Bond (an ancestor of the present
clerk, Mr. Capel Bond) was appointed clerk and sexton, at a
salary of &pound;4 a year and fees.</p>

before-mentioned. During the Civil Wars there are fewer
entries of marriages than usual, but no other feature of
interest presents itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>The churchwardens' account book begins in 1673, and contains
much that is noteworthy. In those days the churchwardens
seem to have been the regular factotums of the
parish. They received from the Mayor, at Midsummer and
Christmas, the benefaction known as Lord Coventry's money,
and distributed to nine poor persons, whose names are entered
in the book, at the rate of 3s. 4d. each; and there is a longer
list of those who received charity on St. Thomas's Day.
Irish vagrants greatly infested the city, and drew largely on
the parochial funds; maimed and disabled soldiers and sailors,
and numbers of distressed persons who had seen better days,
or who had been "ruinated by fire," constantly appealed to
the popular benevolence.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"To a distressed gentlewoman and her company, 14 in all, 2s."</p>

<p>"To 16 Englishmen that were taken by the Dutch and got on
land ageine, 2s."</p></div>

<p>The regular poor seem to have been treated pretty liberally.
Pauper children were taught to read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"For hornbook and primmer for Jenkins' girle to learn to
read, 6d."</p>

<p>"To a woman for curing a foundling boy of a broken belly, 10s."</p></div>

<p>Midwives and "gossips" were paid by the churchwardens,
and at the christening the parson received 1s., the clerk 6d.,
and registration 4d. Minute details of expenses incurred
for individual paupers are amusing enough:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Paid Goodman Dooding for dressing of Mary Leonard's legg,
and to buy salve by consent of the parish, 5s."</p>

<p>"Paid Mr. Hill for cloth and thred for two shirts for old Panting,
he being full of vermin, 5s. 9-1/2d.; and for making, 8d."</p></div>

<p>Indications are apparent of the great severity of the small-pox
at the close of the seventeenth century, and the physicking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
for this and other diseases was considerable: a mixture was
charged 1s. 6d., a bolus 10d., a "vomitt" and a bottle of
syrup 8d., a "cordiall draught" 14d., "a mass of pils" 3s.,
a glass of tincture 1s., and a "Hipnott (?) mixture" 1s.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Paid Ald. Tyas' bill for medicines to Mr. Blackwell and Joan
Harris' legg wch was cutt off 11th Nov. (1698), broke by Mrs.
Hammons' cart, for subsistence in her distress for 20 weeks and her
mother-in-law to keep her, &pound;1. 10s."</p>

<p>"Paid Mr. Blackwell and Mr. Sambach for cutting off the leg and
curing it, &pound;4."</p>

<p>"For wooden leg for Joan Harris, 3s. 10d."</p></div>

<p>A charge of 2s. is made on several occasions for "a Spanish
bag" for pauper women. Can any of my medical or other
readers suggest a solution of this?</p>

<p>One "Jones of St. John's" is commemorated as the recipient
of various supplies of "strong waters," but what the
following entries mean is not very clear:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Given to Jones of St. John's to buy her husband 2 galls of
strong waters and send him abroad that he may not be too
chargeable, 6s."</p>

<p>"For a gall. of strong waters to send Jones of St. John's away to
save him from arrest, 3s. 4d."</p></div>

<p>Nor were the poor forgotten in their deaths: charges were
regularly made for "rosemary and bayes" to put on corpses,
and in one instance the churchwardens paid for the deceased
pauper "an alehouse scoare for her 4d., for a plaster for her
2d., and for the old woman that layd her out 4d." In the
year 1697 a charge of 8d. was made "for an act of Parliament
for badging the poor," which was a copy of a statute for
distinguishing paupers by fixing a badge on their clothes.
Probably mendicancy was becoming a serious charge, and the
legislators of the day thought to reduce it by rendering the
recipients of charity as conspicuous as possible. The act of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Parliament which directed that every pauper should wear a
badge was the statute 8th and 9th of William III, chap. 30,
sec. 2; it was passed in the year 1697. It was not at all
observed for many years previous to its repeal, which was in
the year 1810, by the statute 50th of George III, chap. 52.
The badge contained a large Roman "P" (for poor) and the
initial letter of the parish to which the pauper belonged.
Great exertions were made by the parochial authorities to
shift off the burden of pauperism from their own shoulders to
other parishes, especially in cases of illegitimate offspring. It
is said that whenever the plague prevails in the East, the
afflicted sons of Islam beseech Heaven to relieve their locality
and send the scourge to the next town. Our own parish
registers prove that Christians share the same feelings in
common. Here are instances:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Given to Ann Hector, she being ready to cry out for a midwife,
and to lodge her in St. Martin's parish, 2s."</p>

<p>"Paid Fabian Lancett's wife and another woman for watching a
woman a night and a day for fear the woman should lye in our
parish, 2s. 6d."</p>

<p>"Paid for a lycence to marry Mary Paine (she being big with
child) to Sam. Sarles, to prevent more charge to the parish,
&pound;1. 1s. 4d."</p>

<p>"Paid for licence for ye marriage of Widow Holmes, &pound;1. 1s. 4d.</p>

<p>"Ale when the match was made, 1s. 6d.</p>

<p>"Gave them to buy necessaries, 2s."</p></div>

<p>Money was likewise paid to women, as a bribe, to divulge
where their illegitimate offspring were born; and one William
Pennell seems to have had the task assigned to him of hunting
up this class of ladies and escorting them out of the parochial
bounds, while Ann Williams enjoyed the not more enviable
vocation of "begging clouts" for the unfortunate youngsters.
A fellow named Hackluitt, in the year 1680, transgressed the
rules of chastity with "ye maid at ye White Heart," and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
result was the birth of a boy; but the father had then fled,
and the churchwardens were in great consternation at the
probability of this illegitimate burden. A considerable number
of items are entered in the books of sums spent upon the
inquiry after the vagrant sinner and for maintaining his child.
At length he was discovered, and negotiation was then resorted
to, the putative father, apparently under the influence of drink,
acceding to the "points" proposed as the basis.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Spent at White Heart when he agreed to take away his
child, 4d."</p></div>

<p>But in 1682 this heartless Don Juan had again abandoned
his offspring, and another personage appears on the scene:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Spent in discoursing with old Hackluitt about his sonne's child
left in this parish, 2s. 4d."</p></div>

<p>A considerable expenditure followed, for "whittles and
other necessaries" for the child; but as Hackluitt senior
does not seem to have seconded the proposition that he
should pay for his son's delinquencies, the churchwardens
apparently became tired of the onus, and at last&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Paid to a poor woman for carrying him out of town, 1s."</p></div>

<p>How the wretched brat was really disposed of does not appear
in this rather mysterious record. There was probably a poorhouse
or lying-in hospital at the Cross, as various memoranda
are made of women being "delivered at the Cross." Was
this at the old workhouse at the site of the present Hop
Market? There is also one instance of</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Paid to a woman <i>and her husband that lay in</i> at the widow
Winn's, 1s."</p></div>

<p>The love of feasting at the public expense is as apparent
in this churchwardens' book, though on a small scale, as in
the old corporation archives, which I have already published.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
A dinner was always provided to commemorate the election
of the churchwardens. When Mr. Thomas Shewring and
Mr. Thomas Elcox were appointed, in 1673, the following
provision was made:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"A crop of beefe, wtt, 47 lb., att 2-1/2d., &amp;c., 10s. 3d.</p>

<p>"Two quarters veale, 9s. 10d.</p>

<p>"A dozen piggeons, 18d.</p>

<p>"Butter, flour, making, and baking, altogether, 4s. 9-1/2d.</p>

<p>"9 lb. baccon of the ribbs at 5d., 3s. 9d.</p>

<p>"Mr. Ferryman for tobacco, 3d.</p>

<p>"Mr. Thomas Vicaris for bread, beare, pipes, tobacco, and all other
materials, and to cleane the house, and for dressing the dinner, &pound;1."</p></div>

<p>A quarter of lamb was 1s. 10d.; 5 lb. of candles for ye
parish lanthorn, 9d.; two fat pigs, 5s.; a leg of mutton,
1s. 8d.; capers, 4d.; orange and lemon, 4d.; and a soft cheese
(probably cream cheese) is charged 1s. in 1691; 2 lb. "candles
to burn by ye church side winter nights," 8d.; and "four
tunnes and a halfe of coles att 6s. 4d. pr tunn," &pound;1. 8s. 6d.
Dinners or drinking bouts, or both, were given on procession
days, visitation days, and at "the assessing the rolls"&mdash;that
is, when the poor-rate (if so it might be called) was assessed
on the parishioners. The "processions" probably were the
same as the perambulations, or "beating the bounds," the
churchwardens apparently taking a personal survey of the
parish boundaries once a year, in the month of May, and
immense preparations were made for that purpose, including
(in 1674) half a gross of pipes, 6d.; half a pound tobacco,
10d.; and "paid for ale before our own was tapped," 4d.
Each parish in those days kept its own "church ales."
Charges are made for dozens of "white <i>poyntes</i> for the boyes"
in these perambulation accounts. Were these wands, or what
else? The perambulating party generally wound up the day
at the Globe, where they dined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>Rentals accruing to the parish in 1695 amounted to
&pound;74. 18s. 7d., which included &pound;2. 3s. a year for the "oatmeal
market" (Mealcheapen Street), also the rents of the Pheasant,
the "baccon market," and some meadows at Hindlip. In
1705 the rents were under &pound;60. Charges were made "for
work done at the oatmeale bench," probably a bench fixed
outside the east end of the church for the use of the dealers
in meal; likewise "for laths and nails for mending ye church
penthouse." This penthouse was perhaps the "purpresture"&mdash;a
name then given to booths or stalls placed in the streets
for the exhibition or sale of goods, and for which encroachment
on the highway a pecuniary acknowledgment was paid to the
corporation.</p>

<p>The receipts of the churchwardens in 1680 amounted to
&pound;53. 1s. 3d.; disbursements, &pound;57. 13s. 5d. In 1683, receipts,
&pound;117; disbursements, only &pound;48. In 1684, receipts, &pound;144;
expenditure, &pound;62. In 1705, receipts, &pound;131; expenses, &pound;154.
Pentecostals (a sum raised at a farthing per head from the
householders in a chapelry or dependent church, and paid to
the mother church at Whitsuntide&mdash;hence called "Whitsun
farthings") were paid to the Dean and Chapter, St. Swithin's
being a rectory in the gift of that body. Dr. Burn in his
"Ecclesiastical Law," vol. iii, p. 110, says&mdash;"Pentecostals,
otherwise called Whitsun farthings, took their name from
the usual time of payment at the feast of Pentecost. These
are spoken of in a remarkable grant of King Henry VIII
[dated January 25, 1541] to the Dean and Chapter of
Worcester, in which he makes over to them all those oblations
and obventions, or spiritual profits, commonly called Whitsun
farthings, yearly collected or received of divers towns within
the archdeaconry of Worcester, and offered at the time of
Pentecost. From hence it appears that Pentecostals were
oblations." "These oblations grew by degrees into fixed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
certain payments from every parish and every house in it,
as appears not only from the aforementioned grant of King
Henry VIII, but also from a passage in the Articles of the
Clergy in the Convocation in the year 1399, where the sixth
article is an humble request to the archbishops and bishops
that it may be declared whether Peter's Pence, the Holy
Loaf, and Pentecostals, were to be paid by the occupiers of
the lands though the tenements were fallen or not inhabited,
according to the ancient custom when every parish paid a
certain quota. These are still paid in certain dioceses, being
now only a charge upon particular churches, where by custom
they have been paid; and if they be denied where they are
due, they are recoverable in the spiritual court." A table
of the Whitsun farthings payable in every parish in the
diocese of Worcester is given by Dr. Nash in his "History of
Worcestershire," vol. i. The clerk's wages in 1690 amounted
to &pound;2. 4s. 8d.; the sexton's, 18s.; and the ringers seemed
to have had a perpetual license to make as much noise as
they liked, and on all occasions, however contradictory: for
instance&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"1688.&mdash;May 29. Wringing for the birth of the Prince of
Wales, 10s.</p>

<p>"At ye news from Ireland, 2s."</p></div>

<p>Mr. W. Riley, in 1736, presented an organ to St. Swithin's
church, and up to the present century it was the only church
in the city that could boast of either organ or chimes. I find
that at least half a century before Mr. Riley's presentation
was made, there was an organ here; for in 1692 Mr. Birch
charges &pound;3 for mending it; and the organist, Mr. Browne,
receives &pound;5 a year salary. Wine for the communion for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
whole year (1672) cost &pound;1. 16s.; bread for ditto, 1s. 5d. The
offerings at the sacrament varied from 9d. to 12s., but there
is the following entry for 8th June, 1673, when the Test and
Corporation Act first required all officers, civil and military,
to receive the sacrament according to the Church of England:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Received at the great communion, when Mr. Mayor and the
greatest part of the Chamber received the Lord's Supper according
to an act of Parliament to that purpose, &pound;1. 7s."</p></div>

<p>St. Swithin's was probably the then parish church of the
mayor. I suppose the mayor did not attend the Cathedral
officially on public occasions before 1 Edward IV, as on the
20th of January in that year the Prior of Worcester granted
the corporation a permission to attend divine service at the
Cathedral, attended by their officers.&mdash;See "Nash's Worcestershire,"
vol. ii, p. 309.</p>

<p>Entries frequently occur of "chimney money" paid for
poor widows and others during the reign of James II. Was
this a national or local tax? Returns were ordered by parish
constables, in the latter half of the seventeenth century, of
all fire hearths and stoves in every house rateable to church
and poor, and this was probably in reference to the "chimney
money" above alluded to&mdash;being a tax which poor widows
and others, not being absolutely paupers, were unable to
pay. The ministers who preached here&mdash;probably on special
occasions only&mdash;had each a bottle of wine given them; and
means were taken to prevent any "backing out" on the part
of the juveniles when the sermon was commenced; <i>vide</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Paid Henry Richards for timber, boards, and works, for mending
gallery stayers and stoping the boyes ffrom creeping down, and
making Mr. Panting's stayers to his reading pue, 12s. 7d."</p></div>

<p>Among the noticeable miscellaneous entries are the following:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>(1680.) "Paid Mr. Evans for common prayer book for the church,
14s. 6d."</p>

<p>(1681.) "Paid for engrossing Mr. Mayor's warrant for burying
in woollen. 1s." [I believe an act was passed about this time for
the encouragement of the woollen trade by compelling burials in
woollen.]</p>

<p>(1682.) "Paid 1s. for charcoal to dry the writings in the
treasury" (chest).</p>

<p>"Rosemary and bayes at Christmas, 2s. 6d."</p>

<p>"2 lbs. hogg's liquor (Query, lard?) for the chimes, 7d."</p>

<p>"Paid Ginks to carry the bones to the scullhouse, 3s."</p></div>

<p>The present rector of St. Swithin's is the Rev. R. Sarjeant;
churchwardens, Mr. R. West and Mr. F. Inchle. Population
in 1851, 906.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">Begins</span> with 1564, though it is clearly not so old as
that date, having apparently been copied at a later
period, like the other registers before-named. There
is much beautiful writing about the middle and close of the
seventeenth century, but nothing else noteworthy except
that the marriages fell off considerably about that period.
In 1691 a charge of 5s. was made by the churchwardens to
the clerk for transcribing forty-eight sides of the register.</p>

<p>The oldest account book belonging to this parish I have
been enabled to procure commences in the year 1678; giving
first a catalogue of the parochial charities, in which "poor
auncient maides" are specially remembered, and "Mr.
Bowen's guift in wascoates to poor maides" is mentioned.
Male and female paupers were designated by the terms
"Goodman" and "Goodwife" or "Goody," in lieu of their
Christian names:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Paid Goodwife Gawler (1684) and her daughter when they
went to Malvern to be cured," 3s.</p></div>

<p>Foundlings seem to have been laid at a great many doors
in those days, and the cost of feeding and clothing these
poor little outcasts formed considerable items, of which the
following are samples:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1683.&mdash;"Three yards and a half of cloth to make the foundlinge
and Crutchington's child two coates, 5s. 10d.</p>

<p>"For buttons and thrid and making the two coates, 3s.</p>

<p>"Paid Goody Bray for keeping of a child layd at her doore
three nights, 6d.</p>

<p>"For making of a bond to save ye parish harmless of a childe, 1s. 7d.</p>

<p>"Paid ye biddle for going to bring ye woman and child laid down
in the parish, 6d."</p></div>

<p>That the elementary education of the youngsters was not
forgotten is shown by the great fact, that in 1694 the sum
of 1s. 6d. was invested in "1 doz. ABC, 3 hornbooks, and
one primer." A child's coffin cost half-a-crown; a man's 5s.
Badges or marks for the poor, and sewing them on are
regularly charged for. "Ye King's Tax (4s.) for buryall of
pore people" is first mentioned in 1695, when the duty was
probably first imposed. (See a note on this subject in a
subsequent part of this work.)</p>

<p>One of the latest instances of touching for the "King's Evil"
occurs in 1711, when 11s. were "paid Rogers for carrying of
Walker to London to be touched," and even children were
taken all the way to town in those days of snail travelling
to receive virtue from the royal digits. From hence it would
appear that the efficacy of the stroke was not presumed to
be promoted by the faith or excitement of the patient
(infants being incapable thereof), but purely and solely
from the hereditary virtue of the royal touch, <i>per se</i>. In
1684 the churchwardens paid 1s. "for ye King's declaracon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
touching ye evil." More on this subject appears in a note
on Superstitions.</p>

<p>The following entry refers to the "chimney money" for
the poor, already mentioned in St. Swithin's chapter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1683.&mdash;"Spent on the chimney men when the certificates were
allowed for the poor people," 3s.</p></div>

<p>There is a curious item of 26s. 4-1/2d. being incurred in 1720,
"for attending on Kent when she was sullivated," and a
gratifying instance of the best kind of charity&mdash;that of
enabling the poor to help themselves&mdash;occurs in 1710, when
5s. were spent in "teaching Eliz. Harrison to spin and
card, and for her lodging for a month." The parochial
benevolence does not appear to have been confined to the
parish boundary, nor even to the class of paupers, for in
1693 the sum of &pound;5. 2s. 1d. (equal to &pound;30 of the present
money) was raised here "towards the relief of Francis
Laugher, of St. Peter's, who lost all his corn and other his
substance by a sad and lamentable fire." The guardianship
of the poor as also the office of churchwarden, although an
object of honourable ambition to many, was not welcome to
others, for it was found necessary, in 1709, to order that all
guardians should have 2s. 6d. allowed to defray the charge
of their qualifying; in 1690 Mr. T. Browne offered to be at
the expense of putting out a parish apprentice if he were
excused from serving the office of churchwarden; Mr. Baddeley
and Mr. Weston, in 1720, paid &pound;5 each not to serve as
churchwardens, while at other times handsome presents were
made to the vestry for the same indulgence. In 1684 an
estate at Cradley, called Shewsters, was ordered by the vestry
to be purchased for the poor, and the amount paid for it
was &pound;143. Fifteen years afterwards the title to the said
estate was called in question by one Mr. Millman, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
churchwardens were instructed to defend it. In this they
seem to have been successful, as in 1711 the vestry ordered
that another lease for three lives should be granted on it.
The Shewsters' estate still belongs to the parish, and is occupied
by Mr. William Johnson at a gross annual rental of &pound;20.</p>

<p>Before leaving the subject as affecting the poor of this
parish, and the benefactions made to them, it may be stated
that in 1737 the clothing trade was so reduced here that there
was no "young thriving clothier" to be found to whom the
sum of &pound;5 could be lent gratis. This and other similar cases
afford precedents for vestries to amend and regulate the
appropriation of charities when it is no longer possible literally
to comply with the stipulations of the donor.</p>

<p>The disbursements made by the churchwardens in the
year 1678 were but &pound;46. 15s. 8d.; in 1685 they amounted to
&pound;357. 14s. 8d. owing to extra assessments for the repairs of
the church; but after that period they usually reached to
upwards of &pound;100 per annum. This increasing expenditure
occasioned a movement for economy and a suspicion against
the men in office, who were repeatedly tied down by the
vestry to spend no more than 20s. on the perambulation
day, or the excess would not be allowed them. No practical
result however followed, as the injunction seems to have
been regularly disregarded, and four or five times that sum
not unfrequently spent. The outlay was of course popular
with the people, and hence the impunity. Five shillings
were generally spent in cakes for the boys, and 6d. given
to the person who "carried the bush."</p>

<p>As late as 1798 an order was made for the usual perambulation,
but "no dinner at the parish expense." Holy
Thursday was the day for this processioning, or going over
the parish boundary, and the "holy" day was usually terminated
either at the Fish, the Green Dragon, the Falcon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
the George, the Talbot at the Cross, or the Crown and
Sceptre "near the Foregate." A transcript of one of these
processions may not be uninteresting:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Holy Thursday, May 5, 1692, the minister, chwdns and p'ishioners
of ye p'ish of St. Nicholas did goe ye perambulacon, and did remarke

to Mr. Stirrop's parlour window in Angel Lane, over against a stone
in Mr. Savage's wall, from thence back again round by the Cross
to Mrs. Powell's house, widd., now inhabited by Nichs. Nash, mercer,

<p>Besides the large sums spent on the processioning day, the
day of accounts, the election of officers, and assessing the
rolls, charges were constantly made which would sound oddly
enough in the ears of the present generation, for even services
in the cause of charity and religion were not deemed complete
without the unction of large quantities of drink swallowed at
the parish expense. Here are specimens:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1687.&mdash;"Spent at the Ffish after the French Protestants' money
was gathered," 6s. 8d.</p>

<p>"Ditto, ditto, when the money was paid in," 2s. 4d.</p>

<p>"Spent at Ffish with severall p'ishioners abt ye comandments,"
1s. 6d.</p></div>

<p>Among other curious sources of expenditure are the following:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>1681. "Paid Mr. Lea for howsling pence (or huslinge money,
as it is elsewhere called), 11d."</p></div>

<p>This probably means what is now called Sacrament-money.
Howsel, an ancient name for bread, was in former times
applied to the sacrament of the eucharist, as before the
Protestant Reformation the sacrament of both kinds was
restricted to the clergy, and the sacramental cup was forbidden
to the laity. In the certificates of colleges and
chantries for Worcestershire, 2 Edward VI, the persons who
received the holy communion are called "howsling people";
and in the line in Hamlet, where the Danish prince, after
complaining that his father had been sent out of the world
before his time, adds&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"With all his imperfections on his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Unhouselled</i>, unanointed, unannealed,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>he evidently means that his royal sire had not received
the last offices of religion; "unhouselled" meaning that he
had not received the sacrament of the eucharist; "unanointed"
that he had not received the Roman Catholic
sacrament of extreme unction; "unannealed," or as it should
be <i>unanknelled</i>, that he had not had the passing bell tolled
for him as he was dying, to cause all pious Christians to
pray for his soul.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1679.&mdash;"For a warrant to take the names of the Papists," 6d.</p></div>

<p>This was probably in consequence of the excitement following
the discovery of Titus Oates's Popish plot.</p>

<p>A subsequent allusion to the Romanists occurs many years
afterwards, when it was "agreed that Papist Franks' child be
put on the roll," as though it had been a matter of grave
deliberation first. I suppose this means, that belonging to
Popish parents precluded children from the benefit of being
put on the rolls for parochial relief, but that after some <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>discussion
this single case (perhaps a pressing one of destitution)
was admitted.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1682.&mdash;"For paceboard for the excomunicated p'sons," 4d.</p>

<p>1683.&mdash;"Charges of the excomunication," &pound;6. 10s.</p></div>

<p>The above charges were probably for a list of Papists and
others who had been excommunicated in the Ecclesiastical
Court here, and which list was fixed to the church door.
Excommunication may still in some cases form part of the
sentence of our ecclesiastical courts, but is now regulated by
the statute 53 George III, chap. 127.</p>

<p>The most recent remarkable instance of excommunication
was that of the celebrated Mr. Michael Scales, who, in
Trinity Term, 1829, was excommunicated for brawling in
the church of St. Mary, Stratford Bow, in the county of
Middlesex; and in this case Dr. Lushington, in delivering
judgment said, "In the year 1813 an act was passed effecting
an alteration by changing the punishment annexed to the
penalty of excommunication; the court, however, is not
released from passing a sentence of excommunication, but
the consequences of that sentence are very different from
what they were before the passing of the 53 George III,
chap. 127. Since the passing of that statute the ancient
punishment of excommunication is taken away&mdash;the person
excommunicated incurs no civil penalties except such imprisonment
as the court, in the exercise of its discretion,
may think proper to direct, not exceeding six months."</p>

<p>Mr. Scales was sentenced to seven days' imprisonment, but
the King's Advocate (Sir Herbert Jenner Fust) said that he
would rest contented with the sentence of the court without
proceeding to enforce its further execution.</p>

<p>A full account of this case will be found in Dr. Haggard's
"Consistory Reports," vol. ii, p. 566.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>1691.&mdash;"Spent at 2 ffaires for the arresting of Wormington and
p'cureing a bond," 18s. 8d.</p>

<p>1693.&mdash;"Paid for the prayers for their ma'ties fleete," 6d.</p></div>

<p>This was probably during an expedition of William III
against France.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1703.&mdash;"Paid Mr. Cook for printing his sermon," &pound;4. 15s.</p>

<p>1708.&mdash;"Ordered (in December) that &pound;5 be paid to Mr. Taylor,
the curate, for preaching a sermon every sacrament day in the afternoon
since Easter last."</p>

<p>1720.&mdash;"Paid for the use of a pillion," 1s. 6d.</p>

<p>"For a litter from Oxon," 2-1/2d.</p></div>

<p>Rosemary and bayes were very regularly distributed about
the church at Christmas. The bread for the communion for
the whole year 1678 amounted to but 1s.; the wine, &pound;1. 5s. 6d.
Money collected at the communion in 1680, about &pound;2, in
seven collections. In 1684&mdash;bread, 3s. 6d.; wine, &pound;4. 14s. 7d.
Mr. Stephen Ashby, in 1737, "gave 20s. to the rector for
preaching a sermon on Good Friday, suitable to the great
subject of the day; and it is desired that the inhabitants of
St. Swithin's may have liberty to attend the service and
sermon, and that the blessed sacrament of the Lord's Supper
may be administered that day, if there shall be a sufficient
number of communicants." An inventory of the furniture
belonging to the church in 1680 included "one English Bible,
eleven service books, a book of homilies, Paraphrase of
Erasmus, one book Jewell's works, one book called Musculus,
one book of the Whole Duty of Man [two years previously
three books of the Whole Duty of Man were entered as
having been given to the parish], four books given by Mr.
Griffith, the rector, being the Companion to the Temple, two
parts, the Companion to the Altar, and the Occasional Office
of Matrimony, a book of cannons, a book concerninge God
and the Kinge," besides books for the poor, communion plate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
green carpet, &amp;c. A charge of 1s. 8d. for chaines and staples
for the books in the church was made about the same time.
In the year 1680 an old vestry order was revived, "That the
clerk should buy and maynteyne sufficient ropes whenever
required, and to have the benefit of the ringing the bells."
The clerk was also discharged from keeping the clock, and it
was ordered that some skilful person should be chosen for the
purpose and paid 20s. yearly; but some twenty years after
that a much more economical arrangement was made with one
John Cox, who was paid 25s. "for mending the clock, upon
his promise to keep it in order 21 years at 5s. a year." A
new ring of bells for this church was cast at Bromsgrove in
1715. Patching up the old church was a frequent source of
great outlay for some years before it was determined to build
a new one. In 1682 the "pillar near the great door" being
much decayed, and endangering the structure, and other
repairs being needed, they were ordered to be done. I find
that the cost of 400 tiles was 6s. 8d., 20 bushels of hair 6s. 8d.,
400 Wyer brick 6s. 8d., 5 loads of sand 7s. 6d., eight loads of
stone (from Ombersley) &pound;2, lime 5d. a bushel; the workmen
generally had 1s. a day, while others had more or less. Green
flannel was bought for "the 48 seats," (the corporation), and
red tape to be nailed on it. Three years afterwards an order
was made to repair the church again at a cost of &pound;150, and two
men named Allibone and Pascall "to have ye job," Mr. Emes
to give security for its proper performance. Malt was bought
to make drink for the workmen. Three and a half yards of
damask for the communion table were then charged &pound;1. 2s. 9d.
Next year the chancel was out of order, and a buttress was
put up. In 1690 the steeple underwent reparation. Then it
was found that the accommodation of the church was not
sufficient, and in 1697 it was ordered, "That my Lord Bishopp
be waited upon by the minister to desier his fyatt for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
building a new gallery." The four front seats of this gallery
were "put in order and matted fitt for ye gentlewomen to sit
in." Only two years elapsed when the old vestry was ordered
"to be taken down and removed to next pillar, and to be put
in decent order for the parishioners to meet on all parish
accounts." Then, in 1707, a new gallery was ordered to be
erected under the west window, "in the most decent and
workmanlike manner that can be found out and advised by
able workmen, and that the pulpit, seats, and font, be removed
and made more convenient." At length the old fabric was
found not to be worth any further outlay, and it was pulled
down in 1728. The vestry meetings were then held in the
Berkeley chapel, also at several inns and private houses.
[The Hop-pole is first mentioned in 1742, and the Star and
Garter in 1748. Mr. G. Woodcock was the landlord of the
former, and Mr. William Dyer of the latter.] The trustees
appointed under the act for taking down and rebuilding the
church were Mr. Thomas, Mr. Weston, Alderman Weston,
Martin Sandys, Alderman Vaughan, Alderman Floyer, Mr.
Hayles, Mr. John Nichols, Mr. Ashby, Mr. Mence, Alderman
Hopkins, Dr. B. Purshall, and the churchwardens. Captain
Wingfield, Mr. Sambach, and Mr. Garway, were afterwards
chosen trustees to act with the others in carrying on the
building. It was ordered that all gifts to the parish should
be paid to the treasurer of the trustees, and the parish to pay
the interest as directed by the wills of the respective donors.
[I mention this in consequence of the bearing it has on a
recent church-rate discussion here.] When the trustees
should be reduced to thirty, any nine of the survivors were to
fill up the number. Sums were borrowed at common interest
and others as annuities, and heavy rates were levied. Great
difficulty was experienced in raising the amount, the whole
expense of the church being &pound;3,345. It was ordered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
prosecute all defaulters in the Ecclesiastical Court, except
Quakers, who were to be brought before the magistrates;
and among other modes of raising funds were the following:
Alderman Weston gave &pound;20 for a seat under the south
window next the tower; Mr. Sandys and Mr. Mence &pound;100
each for having conveyed and assured to them the two galleries
on each side of the tower; and an order was made
that the &pound;20 given by Mr. Ashby for preaching a sermon on
Good Friday be laid out on building a wall and enclosing the
churchyard. The first vestry was held in the new church in
1730, when it was ordered that the seats should have numbers
or figures put on them; "the persons to sit in them according
to their weekly payments to the poor; and if any one should
sit in a seat above his weekly pay he or she shall be immediately
charged according to the figure on the seat."</p>

<p>The Salt Market was held in the parish of St. Nicholas. At
a parish meeting in 1792 it was agreed "That whereas there
is a stage erected before the Salt Market, to the great prejudice
and forestalling of the p'ish tenants, who pay considerable
rents to the use of the poor of St. Nicholas, that all and every
person," &amp;c., should be proceeded against as counsel should
advise. The site of the Salt Market was what is now the garden
in front of the rectory house, close by the church. There was a
stonemason's yard behind, and in the rear of that yard was a
house which, by the addition of a new front, has been converted
into the present rectory. Mr. Young, who is now living at
the age of about eighty-three, informs me that he can recollect
a man regularly selling salt at a small open shop or stall on
the site in question. Three or four centuries ago the Salt
Market was at "the well of Allhallow," near All Saints'
church. In 1692 the parishioners were "p'sented for ye
repaire of the way from Foregate to the Pound, in St.
Martin's, lying near the town ditch," which had hitherto been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
repaired by the inhabitants living there, or else by the chamberlain
of the city, the churchwardens therefore were instructed
to litigate the point, and no further entry occurs on the subject.
There was also much disputation about some property in the
Butts, and at length "Wm. Lygon, Esq., John Price, chancellor,
James Nash, of Martley, gentleman, and John
Appletree, Esq., were requested to be arbitrators for the parish
in a matter between ye p'ishioners and Mary Solley, widow,
concerning the retakeing of the gravel butts and setting forth
ye said butts and ye boundaries thereof." In 1770 a lease of
"the rector's ten tenements at the bottom of Gaol Lane" was
granted for fifty years, at a rental of &pound;21. 10s., for a workhouse.
This Gaol Lane was the present Nicholas Street,
where also were several almshouses, repaired by the parish.
The lane led to the old city gaol, which was situate on the site
of the gardens and property now belonging to the Avenue
House (Mr. Powell's) and cottages adjacent in Trinity
Gardens. The entrance to the old gaol was near the premises
in St. Nicholas Street, till recently occupied as a savings-bank.
St. Nicholas Street&mdash;now the principal thoroughfare to and
from the railway station&mdash;was at that time no street at all,
there being no outlet to Lowesmoor except for foot passengers,
who had to go through a narrow entry with turnstile. A public
house called the Dolphin stretched across the street from the
present police station to the point where Mr. Finch's house
now stands, and the entry was at the left of that public
house, close adjoining Mr. Finch's. The last house which
then stood in the lane is still in existence, being occupied by
a broker. Its old doorway and timbers speak for themselves.
Mr. Finch's premises were then a workshop and timber-yard
belonging to a Mr. Powell. The ten tenements above alluded
to, as belonging to the rector, were on the opposite side of the
lane, and were probably used as a parish workhouse only from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
1770 till the building of the present House of Industry, about
twenty years later. These tenements are now about to be
sold, under an act passed a few years ago, enabling incumbents
to sell dilapidated property for its <i>bona fide</i> value, the proceeds
to be deposited in Queen Anne's Bounty fund, and the
annual value to be paid to the incumbent. The cattle
market was held in Gaol Lane within the recollection
of aged persons now living. A by-law was made in the
time of Henry VII, setting forth that, as the cattle
market in Broad Street was a great annoyance, thenceforth
the Welsh cattle should be brought to Dolday, and
English cattle to Anger (Angel) Lane, and to the "old gayle."
The garden and butter markets were also formerly held in
front of St. Nicholas' church, having been removed thither
from All Hallows Well. A great part of the area in
front of St. Nicholas' church is consecrated ground, the
boundary being still defined by a line of pavement. At
the corner of the churchyard the old watchman's box was
formerly placed. Richard Hill, the late beadle of St.
Nicholas church, had the honour of being the "last man"
of the ancient dynasty of Charleys in this city. He received
a concussion of the brain in a night assault, but after lying by
for some time he recovered and became beadle of the church.
The first mention of public lamps in the churchwardens'
books is in 1698; when it was ordered "Yt the lamps in the
parish, and to be putt up in the parish, be fedd with oyle, and
trimmed and cleaned at the charge of the parish, and that the
churchwardens doe take care to have them lighted all dark
nights in the winter season." Mention of a Sunday school is
made in 1786, when it was agreed that the expense of it
should be paid out of the money collected for the poor, and
a committee was appointed to manage the affairs of the
school. [I find that Sunday schools were ordered to be
established as early as 1570, by the Council of Malines.]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>

<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> oldest register now in this church commences
with 1686; but this book is No. 2, and it is written
at the commencement that "No. 1 contains entries
from 1560 to 1686." No. 1 is, however, missing. In the
early part of the eighteenth century, the entries of the
births of dissenters' children are placed apart by themselves,
as in some other registers which I have inspected. The spirit
which dictated this is, unhappily, not yet defunct amongst us.
There is an entry in 1716 of the name of "Gibbon, son of
Mr. G. Bagnall," who was probably a descendant of that
loyal gentleman who facilitated the escape of Charles II
from the battle of Worcester by lending him his horse when
the king was nearly captured in Sidbury. Several instances
of adult baptism are recorded here, among which is the
following: "Rebecka Nicholas, aged 23, born and bred a
Quaker, was baptised Sep. 3, 1759." Not a few names are to
be met with, both in the registers and churchwardens' books
a century or one hundred and fifty years or more ago, which
are still familiar in the parish&mdash;such as Burlingham, Gorle,
Jenkins, Darke, John Dent, Daniel George, Luke Wells,
Coney, Hartwright, Hickman, Roger Moore, Luke Lench,
&amp;c. It is probable that many of the poor fishermen's
families here have been identified with the parish for a
succession of several centuries, and in particular the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
of one of them (Leonard Darke) seems never to have been
missing, as far back as the records go. No doubt, among
these humble followers of a calling which has been handed
down from father to son for many generations, as also with
innumerable instances of agriculturists, if they possessed the
ambition or the means, they might trace as ancient if not as
distinguished a pedigree as any Norman or Saxon lord of
the soil.</p>

<p>A few notes from the churchwardens' books will suffice.
The oldest of them now to be found begins with the year
1739, and the next with 1770. In the latter, one Charles
Geary exhibits his anxiety to acquaint posterity with the
fact that the holding a churchwardenship is not incompatible
with the loftier aspirations of the poetic muse, thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I bought this book,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in him the p'ishoners may look<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thear they may see<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Was bought by me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Charles Geary."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>On the cover of the same book is the following memorandum:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I have perused the pleadings in a case between John Berkeley,
Esq., plaintiff, and John Sparrow and Thomas Butler, churchwardens
of St. Peter's, defendants, and find that the inhabitants, owners, and
possessors of lands and tenements within the chapelry of Whittington,
in the said parish, are, by the verdict given in the said cause, to pay
one fourth part only of all levies and charges for repairing of the
said parish church of St. Peter's and the ornaments thereof, and
also one fourth of all charges for bread and wine used at the communion
there.&mdash;John Farmer. July 4, 1752."</p></div>

<p>Among the charges pertaining to the church, in the same
year, a new clock and dial, three feet square, by Mr. John
Steight, cost &pound;13. 10s.; and three years afterwards the vestry
made an order to "buy a new pulpit of the Dean and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Chapter for eight guineas, that they had lately made and
was not then in use." No such heavy expenses were
incurred in this parish as in St. Nicholas's for perambulation
purposes or other feasting, and indeed the scale of
the disbursements generally betokened St. Peter's to be
much the poorer parish of the two. &pound;3. 9s. was charged in
1761 for "going the bounds." In 1774, I find that the turnpikes
to Feckenham cost 3d. for a horse; hire of the animal,
2s.; hay and corn, 6d.; dinner and drink for the rider, 1s. 6d.
The lamps first put up in this parish were under the care of
the churchwardens, who were ordered to appoint a person to
trim them. Mr. Nathaniel Wilkinson&mdash;who has been rendered
famous by his erection of the beautiful spire of St.
Andrew's church&mdash;was an inhabitant of St. Peter's; and in
1750 I find an order that Mr. Wilkinson's accounts should be
examined, "and if he do not submit them for inspection an
attorney be employed." It ever seems the fate of genius to
contend with pecuniary difficulties.</p>

<p>I now come to the management of the poor. As in all other
parishes to whose records I have had access, the greatest
vigilance was exercised to pass on tramps and get rid of
paupers, especially that class of females who evidently contemplated
an increase of the population, and these are invariably
designated by a term which will not exactly suit the fastidious
readers of the nineteenth century. In 1739 Leonard Darke is
ordered "to have the badche (badge) put upon his sleeve as
the act of Parliament directs, before the churchwarden relieves
him or his wife; and that all other people that receive reliefe
from the parish be obliged to wear the badge." In the same
year&mdash;"Paid to gett a stranger out of the parish troubled with
fitts, 1s." In 1746&mdash;"Ordered that the churchwardens do
agree with the London carryer in the best manner that he can
to take Ann Nelson back to Christ Church parish in London,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
from which she was sent by a pass directed to the churchwardens
and overseers of the poor of the city of Worcester."
See how the authorities of those days enforced seducers to
make the <i>amende honourable</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1780.&mdash;"Paid to Ann Williams, examination and oath relative to
her parish, 2s.</p>

<p>"Her examination and oath touching the father of the child, 2s.</p>

<p>"A warrant to apprehend the father, and expenses of constables
and assistants in taking him, &pound;1. 18s.</p>

<p>"Paid for the ring, 4s.</p>

<p>"Licence, &pound;1. 8s.</p>

<p>"Pd parson, clerk, and sexton, 8s.</p>

<p>"For the wedding dinner and drink, 11s. 6d."</p></div>

<p>There was no middle way left for this description of sinner
but a long incarceration in gaol or a procession to the hymeneal
altar in company with her whom he had outraged. The
prospect of the gratuitous "dinner and drink" no doubt
decided the point. Lunatics were treated in an equally characteristic
manner.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1753.&mdash;"Paid for necessaries for Rd. Strayne, 1s. 6d.</p>

<p>"Two hopsacks for a bedtick for him, 3s. 4d.</p>

<p>"Straw for him, 6d.</p>

<p>"A nurse to look to him, 1s. 6d.</p>

<p>"Paid a man to help to chain him, with expenses, 3s.</p>

<p>"Two staples, a chain, and a lock, 8d."</p></div>

<p>The small-pox and the itch were the two greatest scourges
of pauperism in those days, and it seems that even then
(though I was not aware of the fact before) the contract
system was resorted to in reference to both the sick and able-bodied
poor. In 1779, Mr. William Dunn, apothecary,
contracted with St. Peter's vestry to supply the poor of the
parish in the workhouse with medicines and proper attendance
for the sum of &pound;7. 7s. for three years. Six years later, Robert
Tasker, governor of the workhouse, contracted to lodge, clothe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
keep, and manage the poor for three years, at &pound;185 per annum:
and in 1791 Robert Tasker again contracted for &pound;195, and
&pound;10 was then further paid to him "for extras during the last
three years and for his particular care and attention to
lunatics." But in reference to the workhouse question we
must retrace our steps as far back as 1746, when the vestry
requested the churchwardens "to take to their assistance
others of the parishioners, and draw a scheme for establishing
a workhouse in the parish." Ten pounds a year was fixed as
the salary of the governor, Zachary Humphries, and "a proper
person was to be employed to instruct young persons and
others in the workhouse in pareing of leather, sewing of gloves,
spinning, or other employments." One shilling a week was
allowed to the governor for every person admitted to the
house. At the same time it was ordered that "the house now
rented by the parish of Mr. Brooker, the minister, be converted
into a workhouse, and fitted up in a fortnight." In 1771 it
was apparently found that the accommodation was insufficient,
as an order was made "That a workhouse be set on foot and
established as speedily as may be." Exactly twenty years
later it was resolved to concur in the plan of a general workhouse,
and delegates were appointed to attend the general
committee. Great opposition, however, was raised, in consequence
of an outcry against the suppression of the parochial
system&mdash;as usual, no doubt, by interested individuals having a
tender regard for the abuses of the old plan, for this has ever
been the experience attending great measures for the public
good. In the following year therefore (1792), at a vestry
meeting convened to consider the bill for establishing a House
of Industry, it was resolved, by a majority of forty-five to reject
the bill "as unnecessary for this parish;" and a Mr. James
Holyoake, referring to his vote at the last parish meeting
respecting this business, "begs leave to observe as to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
division of parishes. Out parts of parishes cannot be divided
from such parts as in the city. Parishes united or consolidated
must remain so, unless altered or divided by act of Parliament;
and if this is, or intended to be, a part of the bill, the said
James Holyoake doth on his own part protest against such
clause being inserted therein; and it is submitted that a review
should be taken of all the public acts made and passed by the
legislature for the relief, support, and government of the poor
in general. Abstract and consider the clauses of these acts of
Parliament; consider the acts at large, and give reasons why
the ministers, churchwardens, and overseers, should not
continue to be the lawful trustees, guardians, and representatives
of their churches and parishes for the relief, support,
and government of the poor; and determine (if you can) why
the ministers, churchwardens, and overseers, should be
restrained from representing and doing the duties belonging
to their churches and parishes; and why they, or their
churches and parishes, should be superseded or directed by
any particular set of people on earth. And should not the
clause No. lxiii in the said bill, intended for the better relief
of the poor of the city of Worcester, conclude thus&mdash;'It is
intended to be a private act.'"</p>

<p>The year 1793, however, saw the establishment of the
general workhouse on Tallow Hill; and in the first year
of the operation of the new plan, although the poor were
very largely increased above the average of preceding years,
the total cost of their maintenance amounted to a less
sum than before. The parishes incorporated by this act were
All Saints, St. Andrew, St. Alban, St. Clement, St. Helen,
St. Martin, St. Michael, and St. Swithin, and the average
expenditure of these parishes for the poor for five years
preceding amounted to &pound;1525 per annum, as follows: All
Saints, &pound;290; St. Andrew, &pound;182; St. Alban, &pound;47; St. Clement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
&pound;108; St. Helen, &pound;187; St. Martin, &pound;255; St. Nicholas, &pound;303;
St. Swithin, &pound;153. The present Hop Market had been a
workhouse (prior to the establishment of that on Tallow Hill)
for probably a century, as I find that in 1699 the Foregate
was pulled down in order to build a workhouse.</p>

<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">On</span> the first page of the oldest register book here is
the following memorandum: "This register of St.
Andrew's parish, Worcester, was found among old
rubbish in the churchyard by W. Wormington, rector, 1779."
The first entry is under date 1549, and a note in the
margin observes, "Four years before the death of Edward
the Sixth." A large portion of the book appears to have been
copied, and births, marriages, and deaths, are irregularly
intermixed. It terminates with the year 1619. The next
oldest register commences with 1673. The account book is
thus prefaced: "The booke of the accomptes of the churchwardens
of the parishe of St. Andrewes within the cittie of
Worcester made and begonne this present year of o<sup>r.</sup> Lord
God 1587, beynge the thirtyeth yeare of the raigne of o<sup>r.</sup>
sov'aigne ladie Queene Elizabeth." The book (which, as
a memorandum on it states, cost xii pence) ends with 1631;
it is on thin paper, with parchment covers. Two other
books, both belonging to a later part of the seventeenth century,
give the accounts of what was received and "disbusted" for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
church and poor. This is therefore one of the oldest parochial
records in Worcester, and as may be expected contains
much that is interesting. As usual small Roman numerals
are used in the accounts, figures making their appearance
about the year 1600, but these were apparently considered
so awkward or unintelligible as to lead to their abandonment,
and many years elapsed before they were finally introduced.
How the venerable guardians of the church could have persisted
in the use of such an impracticable method of arithmetic
in the face of so great an invention as that of figures,
is only to be accounted for by the blind and obstinate attachment
of human nature to traditional usages.</p>

<p>In the time of Queen Elizabeth the seats in this church
were let, at the rate of from 6d. to 1s. per annum each
sitting, and some instances occur of sittings for a man
and his wife being charged 3s., and regularly every year
a large number who removed from their seats to others
were charged 4d. for each removal. The church was
whitewashed at Easter Eve, at a charge of 7s. each time.
In 1600 occurs an item of 43s. "layed out in bildinge ye
new porch," and four years afterwards 5s. "for painting
the king's arms." In 1617, "Paid for mendinge ye chimnie
to keape out smoke out of ye church, 2s." The smoke
nuisance however was not abated, for two years later the
sum of 2s. 6d. was "paid to the goodman<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Bushell for
a day's work and a halfe for him and his man to stopp
the smooke of the church." The "steeple" is frequently
mentioned, and in the year 1618 was "Paid for repayringe
and mendinge of ye wether cocke, 5s. 10d.; guilding ye
cocke, &pound;1." A fatal accident occurred at this time, as sums
are charged for the "buriall of the man who undertook
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>payntinge of ye steeple," and "for coveringe the grave
where the man was buried that was misventured in the
church."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Goodman and goodwife were in those days used in the same way as
Mr. and Mrs. are now.</p></div>

<p>Bells were in those days of universal ringing a source of
very great expense, year after year heavy items being charged
for ropes, ball-ribbs, clappers, or recasting the bells themselves.
In 1589 is this entry&mdash;"Laide out on the singinge
men of the Colledge for hearing the tune of the belles, 6d."
Some of the bells were probably recast on that occasion, and
the Cathedral choir were invited to lend their professional
ears at the tuning of them. "Likewise (in the same year)
the said churchwardens desire to be allowed of divers summes
by them laid out in costes and charges expended at the
Councell in the M'ches in ye parishes cause, concerninge
the castinge of their fowerth bell, altogether 18s. 8d." I have
been unable to ascertain what took this cause to the Council
of the Marches instead of to the Worcester Consistory Court.
At that time the Council usually sat at Ludlow, but for the
greater despatch of business sometimes assembled at Bewdley
and Shrewsbury. "The court of the President and Councell in
the Dominion and Principality of Wales" is mentioned by
Lord Coke in his "Fourth Institute," p. 242, as a court of
equity, held before the President and Council, under the
authority of the statute 34th Henry VIII, chap. 26; and his
lordship says "They sit by force of the King's Commission
and Instructions, and proceed as in a court of equity, by their
wisdomes and discretion. Herefordshire, Worcestershire,
Shropshire, and Gloucestershire, are included in this Commission,
pretending these four shires are within the Marches
of Wales"; but to show that these four shires were no part
of the Marches of Wales, but were English counties, he cites
many authorities, including a decision of all the Judges of
England and Barons of the Exchequer in Lord Zouche's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
case, in Michaelmas Term, 2nd James II. In reference to
St. Andrew's bell, some one must have sued the churchwardens
in this Welsh court of equity. I find that in 1577
two oxen were given to the bishop on coming to this city,
he being Lord Vice-President of the Queen's Council of the
Marches.</p>

<p>A regulation was laid down in 1595 that the bells should
be "charged at every churching and wedding, by consent as
aforesaid&mdash;4d. at every churching, and 6d. at every wedding;
and if any not inhabiting within this parish shall require to
have ringing hereafter at their wedding, they shall paye
towards the reparation of the belles, xii<i>d.</i>" Among the
receipts yearly the sum of 2s. is regularly mentioned as
having been received from the chamberlains for the council
bell. This was probably the bell by which the corporation
meetings were called together, St. Andrew's being the nearest
church to the Guildhall. The receipts for the use of all the
bells in the year 1602 amounted to 11s. 8d. A clock and
chimes also existed here. Among the occasions for ringing
at this church was the following, in 1625:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Paid by Mr. Maior's appointment for ringinge when there was
speeche betwixt our King Charles and the French ladye, 2s. 6d."</p></div>

<p>After the expedition of "his sacred Majesty" to Spain, to
woo the Infanta, that match was broken off, and negotiations
were begun in 1625 for his marriage with the Princess
Henrietta Maria, youngest daughter of Henri IV of France&mdash;an
union the most unfortunate for Charles and for his country,
so adverse were her influences over him, and so unmanly his
acquiescence to her. About the year 1590 the following
inventory was made "of such stuffe as remayneth in the
p'rishe church of St. Andrew at the accompt of John Hiller
and Thomas Hemynge, at the daye of choseing wardens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
when&mdash;A Bible, ii books of Omilies (one is lost), a book of
Comon Prayer, a book of Iniuncons (Injunctions), (this is
lost), the Paraphraces, Emusculus Comon Places, a Comunion
cuppe and a cover, a surples, a cloath for ye Comunion table,
ii church pawles with ii pillowes, a Comunion table with a
frame and a carpet for the same, iii joyned fearms, ii long and
on short, on longe forme with iv feet, a coffer with a locke

laddars, on for the clocke and the other for the steeple, a
dext (desk), with a frame, sixe bells with a clock, chimes,
and the whole furniture thereunto belonging, ii bears (biers),
the rejester book (the parson hath it)." The Paraphrases,
above alluded to, were those of Erasmus, which Cramner
ordered to be set up in every church. "Emusculus's Comon
Places" were contained in a work now in the Royal Library
in the British Museum, which has the following title: "Common
Places of Christian Religion, gathered by Wolfgangus
Musculus, for the use of suche as desire the knowledge of
Godly truthe, translated out of the Latin into Englishe.
Hereunto are added two other Treatises, made by the same
author, one on Othes, the other on Usurye. Londini, Anno
Domini <span class="smcap">M.D.LXIII.</span>" The imprint at the end of the work
(which consists of 1174 folio pages) is&mdash;"Imprinted at
London by Reginalde Wolfe, Anno Domini 1563." In
1604, "a book of cannons for our parson" was purchased
for 16d., and "payed for our Bible 36s." It would appear
that the churchwardens sold Bibles in those days, and it is
even probable that they let out the church Bible to those
parishioners who could not afford to purchase one, for in 1610
occurs this item&mdash;"Imprimis, received for our church Bible,
x<i>s.</i> vi<i>d.</i>" These officers were occasionally overhauled for
neglect of duty, for in 1612 is this entry&mdash;"Payed for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
fees of the Consistory Court when we weare called thither for
not buying Mr. Jewell's works, and likewise about ye broken
bell, xxiii<i>d.</i>" Jewell's works were printed in 1609, and the
Archbishop Bancroft, in his letter to the Bishops, dated 27th
July, 1610 (printed in Dr. Cardwell's Annals of the Reformed
Church, vol. 2, p. 154), desires the Bishops, Chancellors, and
Archdeacons, with the rest of the preachers and ministers,
"to induce the parishioners of every parish to buy one of
the works of Bishop Jewel." In 1610 a "Communion table
with a form" was bought for 6s. 4d., and in 1616 three
trenchers were ordered for the Communion table at a cost of
6d. The cost of bread and wine for the year 1613 was
16s. 8d.; for 1624, &pound;1. 4s. 6d.; and the pence collected at
the communion for the year 1619, &pound;1. 11s. 1d. Wine and
sugar loaves were given to the strange clergymen who
preached occasionally. The vestry resolved in 1598 that 5s.
should be paid for every corpse above the age of ten years
buried in the church, and under that age 3s. 4d., "and to
pave the ground at their own charges." At a later period
the act for burying in woollen was rigidly enforced, for the
benefit of the woollen trade. In 1692, "paid for a warrant
to seize widdow Yates' goods for not making affadavid yt she
was buried in woollen, 1s." Pope alludes to this custom in
the following lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Odious! in woollen! 'twould a saint provoke!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Were the last words that poor Narcissa spoke.)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No, let a charming chintz and Brussels lace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrap my cold limbs and shade my lifeless face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One would not, sure, be frightful when one's dead!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And&mdash;Betty&mdash;give this cheek a little red."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A "prayer for the navie" was purchased in 1596 at a cost of
4d. This was probably during one of the expeditions against
Spain, after the Armada had been disposed of. Of the many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
"briefs" for collections here, one was in 1693 "for the
redemption of captives from ye coasts of Africa," 19s. 3-1/2d.;
and another in 1716 "for the cowkeepers about London,"
10s. 7d. (probably to compensate them for the loss of cattle
by the distemper, which, it will be seen elsewhere, visited
this and the adjoining counties a few years later). Rents of
parish property, fees for bells, and letting church seats, were
the principal sources of income; and as regards expenditure,
the parochial authorities seem to have been remarkably self-denying
in the matter of eating and drinking, as compared
with other parishes. The first mention of processioning is in
1614, when 4d. was "payd for a barge to goe over Severne
when the parishioners went in perambulation;" nothing was
then charged for feasting; but in 1622, 1s. 4d. was laid out
"to make the presession drinke," and 3s. 4d. "to make the
parishioners eat and drink when they went the late perambulation."
The patriotic accountant of 1701 records that there
was spent in that year "at the election of officers according
to Magna Carta, &pound;1," and at the perambulation, with ringing,
13s. The perambulation in 1711 cost &pound;1. 10s. 9d. The
meetings were held at the Plough and the Cock. Rent was
annually paid to the city chamberlains for Lead Lane, afterwards
called Pipe Lane. Was this a right of way over
corporation property? Here is the cost of an inquest in
1678: "Paid to the jewry that viewed the man that was
drowned, 4s.; to the sargeant for warning them, 1s.; the
shroud, 2s. 6d.; four men to carry him to church, 1s." The
Whitsun farthings paid by this parish in 1589 amounted to
2s. 2d., which, at a farthing per head, would make 104 householders,
and this was probably the arrears of two years,
as in 1726 only 1s. 1d. was paid.</p>

<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">Register</span> commences with 1538, but appears to
have been copied in one handwriting from a book of
that date nearly a century later. (See remarks on
St. Michael's.) The period of the Civil Wars is noted by
much confusion, but there is nothing in the book beyond
simple entries of births, marriages, and deaths. The account
books, however, which date from 1682, possess a fair average
amount of interest. In the beginning of last century various
minor improvements and renovations were effected in the
church and with the bells. The "chambermen's seat"
(meaning the corporation), next the reading pew, "was
ordered to be enlarged, and the women's seat next adjoining
to be kept as large as now it is by adding the next seat to it."
A vestry, held September 10, 1706, ordered "that the churchwardens
do article and agree with Mr. R. Sanders,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> bell-founder,
or any other founder, for casting the five bells into
eight," and voted a sum not exceeding &pound;70 for founding and
hanging the same. An agreement was accordingly made with
Mr. Sanders. The five bells handed over to him weighed
85 cwt. 1 qr. 1 lb., and the eight recast 80 cwt. 2 qrs. 15 lb.,
making a difference of 518 lbs., which is charged at 12d. per
lb. This famous octave&mdash;the inscriptions on which, in
honour of Queen Anne and Marlborough's victories over
the French, may be seen in all the local histories and
guide books&mdash;weighed separately as follows: Blenheim,
6 cwt. 0 qr. 27 lb.; Barcelona, 6 cwt. 2 qr. 26 lb.; Ramilies,
7 cwt. 1 qr. 13 lb.; Menin, 8 cwt. 2 qr. 3 lb.; Turin,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>9 cwt. 3 qr. 24 lb.; Eugene, 10 cwt. 1 qr. 3 lb.; Marlborough,
12 cwt. 3 qr. 4 lb.; Queen Anne, 18 cwt. 2 qr. 27 lb. A regular
charge of 1s. is made for ringing the pye-bell between twelve
and one on Christmas Day, which, I suppose, is in some way
connected with the proverbial good cheer of that festive
season, just as the "plum-pudding bell" of St. Martin's, and
"the pancake bell" which was formerly common everywhere
at Shrove Tuesday&mdash;</p>

<p>"For tolling ye passing bell as ye prisoners passed by" (to be
hanged) was also a constant charge, as likewise the bow-bell
(curfew) at night. On the 29th of May, 1723, the churchwarden,
in the exuberance of his loyalty, records the payment
of 5s. "ringing happy, glorious, and miraculous restoration."</p>

<p>The sum of &pound;134 was expended in the repair of the church
in the year 1718, and seven years later &pound;2. 8s. for a font,
&pound;22. 5s. 8d. for communion plate, and &pound;4. 10s. for a communion
cloth. The expenditure for sacramental wine throughout the
whole year 1683 was but 9s. 5d., yet the churchwardens could
make heavy charges for sack, quarts of "muskadell," and
bottles of canary, for their own consumption. In 1727, the
sacramental wine cost &pound;6. 12s. 10d. Every strange minister
who preached at the church&mdash;as was then the custom in all
the parishes&mdash;was rewarded with a bottle of wine, at a
charge of 2s., but whether the guinea fee accompanied it or
not the record doth not say. "Ye parson preaching a
sermon on the powder deliverance," in 1725, received
10s. 6d.</p>

<p>A list is given (in 1683) of the "names of pore persons who
had coats, &amp;c., sent by Mr. Fra. Haynes when he was mayor,
as were bought with ye Quakers' money." No doubt from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
the fines which were levied upon that unhappy sect. (See
subsequent part of this work.) Considerable attention to the
poor is observable in these books. A "Spanish bagg" is
ordered for Joyce Moorton in 1691, at a cost of 1s. What
this article was I have failed to discover. One Stumps, a
female cripple, seems to have occasioned a large outlay: there
is "for Stumps's wooden supporters, 3s.;" "for Stumps's
new leggs, 2s.;" "paid Stumps when she lay in, 6d.;"
"mending Stumps's supporters, 4d.;" "for a new supporter
for Stumps, 2s. 6d." and "for buriall, grave, and coffin for
Stumps's child, 5s. 4d." In 1732, 2s. 6d. was spent in curing
one Panting of a "whorscold" (What disease was this?);
and in the same year, "paid Mr. Hooke for bleeding and
drawing a tooth, 1s. 6d." A room was hired in 1718, for 4s.,
for "Captain Hemming's wife to lye in," but how that lady
happened to come under the cognizance of the parochial
authorities is one of those mysteries which will probably
ever remain so. A few years later occurs this graphic entry:
"Wincot's wife in ye straw (and he not well), 1s." About
the same time 1s. was given "to three poor strangers who
were travelling from Lancashire to Somersetshire, and by ye
account they gave had been slaves in Africa, permitted by
ye mayor to ask alms."</p>

<p>Strenuous exertions were made here, as throughout the
city generally, to check the increase of the pauper population.
Men were paid to watch vagrant women who were in an
interesting situation, and escort them out of the parish&mdash;no
matter where so that they were not in St. Helen's; but
notwithstanding the utmost precautions the number of foundlings
and illegitimates was very great. Where the fathers
of these were known it was very long odds against their
escaping from the wardens, who generally succeeded in tying
that hymeneal knot for them which they themselves ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
to have fastened some time earlier. The prospect of a
capital wedding dinner, all expenses to be paid for them,
and a liberal fee put in their pocket, for the most part
converted these lascivious libertines into honest Benedicts,
and saved the parish the maintenance of the pauper infant.
The accounts abound with such items as these:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Spent with Ben. James, p'swading him to marry Han. Hill, 1s."</p>

<p>"At ye marriage of Bury with Brawler of Powick&mdash;for licence,
&pound;1. 2s. 6d.; spent at ye wedding, 6s. 6d.; to ye bridewell keeper, 1s.;
to ye parson, 5s.; to ye clerke, 1s."</p>

<p>"Expenses for eating and drink, Corfield's marriage with Gould,
3s. 7d.; two men for watching, 2s.; drink when Corfield was taken,
1s. 3d; for ye warrant, 4d.; to cash given ym and marrying, 8s. 6d."</p></div>

<p>In 1720, the sum of 3d. was paid "to ye clerke for
keeping a w&mdash;&mdash; out of ye parish;" and "expenses in
preventing Tomkins marying a w&mdash;&mdash; of All Saints, 9d."
The whole of the parish disbursements in 1682 amounted
to but &pound;31. 18s. 1d., but by 1740 they had reached to &pound;273.
Perambulation expenses increased during the same period
from 12s. to &pound;3. 8s.; and the principal drinking places were
the Globe, King's Head, and Adam and Eve. The churchwardens
were in the habit of sending the mayor a brace
of capons at Christmas "for the house in Dolday," but in
1719 this chief rent was commuted into an annual payment
of 2s., being the usual cost of the capons. In 1703 "it was
agreed to mayntain the lamps with oyle and dressing from
All Hollantide to Candlemas from the Town Hall to the
Colledge gates, at the parish charge by the churchwardens
for the time being;" and in 1740, a sum was "paid ye
clerk for two nights lighting the lamps ye time of ye musick
meeting," that being about the period when the Festivals
were on the point of being established on a permanent and
enlarged basis. What can be the meaning of the following

<p>The Pentecostals or Whitsun farthings paid in this parish
in 1701 amounted to 3s., which, at a farthing per head,
would show 144 paying householders then in the parish,
unless indeed the payment had become a fixed one. There
were said to be 255 houses here in 1779. Whitsun farthings
(alluded to in pages 14 and 23) have been made from chapelries
to their mother church up to a comparatively recent date.
In the Castle Morton parish register is an entry of such payment
at the commencement of the present century. Nash
states that the Whitsun farthings belonging to the Cathedral
of Worcester in 1649, when an act was passed for selling
the lands, &amp;c., of bishops, deans, and chapters, were estimated
at about &pound;5. 5s. per annum. He also gives a list of the
amount due from each parish in the then nine deaneries.

<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">Here</span> I found a register commencing with 1538, nicely
copied in one uniform hand for a series of years.
An hiatus occurs between 1560 and 1573, where the
leaves have been torn out. In the 22nd year of Queen
Elizabeth's reign, "John Wilkinson, the parson," caused to
be entered on the register his license to one Thomas Heywood,
"he beinge very sicke in body," to eat flesh in Lent so long
as his illness continued, and no longer. To show the disturbing
influence of the Civil Wars, it will be sufficient to
state, that only one wedding is recorded in 1643, one in 1644,
four in 1645, five in 1646, and so on. About the year 1653
the entries of a peculiar sort of marriages commence of which
the following are specimens:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Mem. John Cartwright of ye parish of Wellan, and Anne
Elvinges, of ye parish of Handbure, were joined together man and

Worcester, weare married the 26th daye of Maye, 1656, by Mr. John
Nash, on of the justises of the pease of the cittie of Worcester,

weekes, in the market plase of the sayd cittie, accordinge to the
actt of parliment."</p></div>

<p>John Roberts signs himself the "register of Martin's."
The above description of marriages ceased with the close of
Cromwell's protectorate. In 1772 occurs the following:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"N.B.&mdash;Through the omission of Mr. John Giles, curate, no
regular register was kept from this time till Mr. Pearkes, clerk of
the parish, in Oct. 1772, began a private account, from whose copy
the following extracts are taken. The intermediate time, from Dec.,
1769, to October, 1772, is very imperfectly supplied by a few alterations
delivered to the churchwardens in consequence of notice of
the above omissions having been given publicly in the church, and
by advertising in the <i>Worcester Journal</i>."</p></div>

<p>All the old account books belonging to this parish have
been either destroyed or removed into the custody of private
persons who have not the honesty to restore them. Vestry
orders from 1718 and churchwardens' account books from
1783 are the earliest records, and very little of any interest
is to be gleaned from them. Enough, however, remains to
prove that the parish of St. Martin was no exception to the
general rule observed by men in office of immoderately and
shamelessly feasting at the public charge. In 1732 an order
was made that no more public money should be spent at the
perambulations&mdash;or "possessionings," as they were sometimes
termed; and the managers of the workhouse were
prohibited from spending more than 2s. at any meeting, and
that not oftener than once a month. The sum of &pound;5 was
frequently paid to avoid serving the office of churchwarden,
which in those days drew pretty largely upon the time and
attention of the holder. An instance occurred in 1739 of a
strangely perverted feeling in reference to the equality of
worshippers in the house of God, as an order was made
"That the two next seats to the mayor's seat be locked up,
and that the clerk of the parish do attend the said seats upon
every day of divine service, and not permit any person or
persons that do not pay to the poor to seat themselves
therein till after the persons who do pay as aforesaid are
first seated." How does this agree with the spirit of Christianity,
as expounded in the Epistle to James, c. ii, v. 2, "For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in
a goodly apparel?" &amp;c.</p>

<p>Great disputes subsequently arose in reference to the free
use of seats in the church; and in 1744 an order was made
that the seat in the first aisle, occupied by Captain Richard
Hemming and his family, should be declared void, and to
be used by the parishioners, and that Mr. B. Russell, the
churchwarden, should take off all locks from the seats in the
church, except such as were held under a faculty. It forms
no part of my purpose to expose parochial abuses, or I
might fill up a large section of this book with the details
of the shameful mismanagement and peculation which in
former years prevailed in the finances of St. Martin's. Much
however has been rectified by the judicious care and public
spirit of Mr. Clapton, one of the churchwardens, but much yet
remains to be done. Among other matters, it appears that
sufficient property has been at various times bequeathed for
the purpose of repairing the church and providing for the
celebration of divine worship, but this property has been
let on long leases for nominal rents, and thus a source of
income which should amount to about &pound;100, and cover
all the necessary expenses of the church, has been allowed
to dwindle away to a bare trifle. It has often been my
misfortune to witness the most unseemly exhibitions of dissention,
mob oratory, and hatred to the church, within the
walls of this fabric, on the occasion of demanding a new
rate. How much would have been spared to the feelings
of the incumbent and to the friends of the Establishment if
the then churchwardens had faithfully and conscientiously
discharged their office in the stewardship of the church
property!</p>

<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">In</span> this parish the date of the oldest register is 1560,
many of the earlier years being evidently copied
by the same hand. An entry of the death of Mr.
Edward Hurdman, who was the last Bailiff and first Mayor
of this city, occurs in 1621: his effigy and that of his wife,
in the attitude of prayer, still remain in an arched niche
to the south of the chancel. In 1638 is recorded the death
of widow Evitt, who buried her husband and her three
children of the plague the year before. The dreadful year
1637 was memorable for the fact that in this city no less
than 1551 persons died of the plague in ten months, being
probably one third of the inhabitants (See "Worcester in
Olden Times," p. 198). On March 20, 1645, is recorded
the burial of a Mr. Richard Chetell, who is said by a local
historian to have been hung before his own door in those
troublous times of Civil War, and to have had a flat stone
placed to his memory near the south aisle of the church,
bearing an inscription to his memory as "the masacred gent."
who died March 19, 1645. Comparing the register with the
date of death recorded on the tombstone, so sudden an interment
would give an air of probability to the tradition. The
coat of arms at the bottom of the slab evidently belongs to the
family of a Mrs. Rebecca Kyrle, who seems to have been
buried in the same vault in 1693. "Collins's fire," an extraordinary
event which took place in October, 1703, is entered in
a red ink or pencil mark, and the register records that, "James
Collins, his wife Ann, with seven children, Ann, James,
Thomas, Mary, Charles, Catharine, and Samuel, all which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
nine persons were burnt together in the fire that burnt their
house." This was a singular story. Collins's maid-servant
was the only inhabitant of the house who escaped from the
fire, but she sustained a broken limb. Afterwards she went
into the service of Mrs. Palmer, of Upton Snodsbury, a lady
who lived on her property. Mrs. Palmer had a son who was
connected with a gang of villains, and in order to obtain her
money these wretches murdered Mrs. Palmer and her maid,
and burnt the house down. So the poor girl escaped from
one fire only to fall into another. The murderers were hung
in chains, and Palmer's estates were forfeited to the Bishop
of Worcester, who applied one of them to found a school
(still existing as Bishop Lloyd's) at Worcester, and the other
to charitable uses.</p>

<p>On inquiring for the churchwarden's account books I was
informed that since the time when John Dench Wensley
(some sixteen or seventeen years ago) so agitated the city
and the old city commissioners with his financial squabbles,
these books had been missing, and that up to a recent period
the accounts had been in a state of great confusion. By the
courtesy of the incumbent and churchwardens, I was enabled
to explore the parochial chest, and soon found that its triple
locks had proved no security against invasion, as not a solitary
book relating to the old accounts was left. Only one fragment&mdash;consisting
of eight or nine leaves, in a piece of brown paper
for a cover, and bearing date 1697&mdash;remained, and this, on
inspection, proved to contain nothing of interest. It is highly
probable the abstracted books are not destroyed; and as they
are of no use to any one, and the party who has been, whether
rightly or wrongly, implicated, being now dead, I trust this
will meet the eye of the individual who has them in his
possession, and that he will be induced at once to restore
them to the church.</p>

<p>A fine black-letter Bible, date 1603, was found in the
chest, and being in tolerable preservation, I am glad to hear
the churchwardens intend to have it strongly bound with the
original wooden covers, which have been torn off.</p>

<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">Beginning</span> with 1558, the register of this parish
goes on regularly to the present time, with the exception
of some omissions in the middle of the seventeenth
century. There are no entries in the year 1637: this was
the year of the great plague in Worcester, when 1551 persons
died here; but as only twenty-six of them were in St. John's it
can scarcely be supposed that the vicar would have abandoned
his post, or neglected the parochial records, on that account.
From 1639 to 1677 all is confusion, entries of various dates
being jumbled together as though from recollection, at various
times after the Restoration. The greatest part of a century
of the early part of the register was evidently copied from
an older one. On one of its covers is the following memorandum::</p>

<p class="center">"John Web's Case.
"1741.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Aug. 2. John Web, of this parish, was buried, with my consent
first obtained, in his wive's grave, in my freehold, my church. Some
time after, his sister, Mrs. Wood, was resolved to lay a large stone
upon his grave without my leave or consent; for this purpose she
sent a stone into my churchyard and demanded of my clerk the
key of my church. My clerk informing me of her intention, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
went into the churchyard and commanded Taylor, the stone cutter,
to take the stone away; and for the insolence of pretending to
break up the soil of my freehold without my consent the stone
should not be put over Mr. Web's grave unless Mrs. Wood payd me
40s. After some time, Mrs. Wood being not able to obtain her end
by the help of a proctor, she sent the proctor, Mr. Greenbank, to
offer me a guinea. I refused the guinea, but told the proctor for
peace sake I would take 25s. and not under. This day, Oct. 28,
1741, Mr. John Young, surveyor of the highways, came to me
from Mrs. Wood and paid me 25s. I then bid him tell Mrs.
Wood that I was satisfied, and gave her leave to lay the stone
upon her brother's grave.</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Abdias Taylor</span>, Vicar.<br />
</p>

<p>"Mem. The stone was laid upon Web's grave, Nov. 2, 1741."</p></div>

<p>St. John's poor's book begins with the year 1692, and ends
with 1713. The only entry in it worth recording is that of
a parish meeting held Aug. 23, 1711, when it was "agreed,
that a penalty of 40s. shall be laid upon the overseers that
pay any of their said poor that receive weekly pay, except
they have the badg fastened visible on the arm, which they
are to wear daily at home and abroad; and in case true information
be made of any or either of the said poor yt neglect
the wearing of the said badg as aforesaid, they are to have
no pay for the week wherein they were found defective."</p>

<p>The oldest account book is one bearing the date 1678,
and is entitled "a booke ordeined to enter ye churchwardens'
accompts of the parryshe of St. John's in Bedwardine, in
the county of Worcester, beginninge in the year aforesaid."
This book (which extends over about fifty years) divulges the
fact that the former inhabitants of this ancient suburb or
township were as famous for their feasting and drinking
propensities as are their descendants of the present day. The
churchwardens and their friends spent large sums of money
on every possible occasion&mdash;at perambulations, at the choosing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
of new wardens on Easter Tuesday, at visitations, binding
apprentices, and so forth. It is curious to remark, as a
proof of the extent to which selfish appetites will mislead
men who have no restraint put upon them, that the charge
for processioning, or "beating the bounds" of this parish,
increased from 3s. in 1678, to &pound;10 in 1818. At first, only
one day was spent in the ceremony, and common ale at a
penny per quart, indulged in, the minister participating;
then the task became too heavy for a single day, and two
were accordingly devoted to the purpose; brandy, tobacco,
and pipes, make their appearance; and before the close of
the seventeenth century three days were occupied in
the procession; dinners at "Powick's bridge" and at
Broadmore Green, Broadheath, sums given to the servants
and children treated with "heavy wet" on the route,
formed the principal features of these drunken scenes.
A small charge was made for "boatinge over the <i>newe</i>
Teame" on these occasions. After inquiry I cannot ascertain
the meaning of this term. Three-pence was also usually
charged "for putting up the Gospel bushes." These were
bushes or boughs carried in the procession and set upright in
the ground at every point where a halt was made to read the
Gospel. Both the Bishop and Dean were treated with wine
whenever they preached here, as was usually the case when
any minister preached who did not belong to the parish;
and when the Bishop vouchsafed his presence, cushions were
borrowed from the Cathedral to accommodate his lordship.
The sum of 5s. was spent upon the Chancellor "when he
came up to see the reparacon of ye church." Muskadell
wine was generally chosen for sacramental purposes, the
charge for it during the whole year varying from &pound;1. 3s.
to double that amount. Bell ringing entailed a heavy yearly
expenditure upon St. John's parish. It seems that they rang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
all day here when the king was at Worcester in 1687, as a
charge of 15s. 11d. was made for the luxury, and also 3s. for
ringing "when the Queen was with child." This child was
afterwards the "elder Pretender," but at the time of the
ringing the nation was looking for the advent of William of
Orange.</p>

<p>In 1707 it was agreed that the five bells should be cast
into six, but there was a stout contest before this was decided
on, there being twenty-five votes for six bells, and eighteen
votes for casting one. The churchwardens were empowered
to treat with a bell-founder, and 5s. was spent at the Angel
during the deliberation. Subsequently 5s. 6d. was charged
for horse-hire in going to Bromsgrove to look after the bells;
Mr. Richard Sanders, of that town, being the founder
selected. Every stage of progress in the transaction was
commemorated by drinking bouts. In 1709 a levy of sixpence
in the pound was made to defray the charge for casting; and
in the following year appears an item of &pound;1. 4s. 11d. for
"meat and drink for the gentlemen who gave judgment on
the bells." These gentlemen were probably of the Cathedral
choir, or some other musical men of the city, called in to
give an opinion as to whether the new bells were in tune&mdash;as
a similar instance, it will be seen, occurred in another parish.
Lastly, the sum of &pound;52. 3s. was paid to Mr. Sanders, apparently
his whole bill for the casting. The entire expenses
of the parish for the year 1680 amounted to &pound;12. 12s. 4d.,
besides &pound;5 distributed to the poor. A barn at Wick was
frequently mentioned as a place where paupers died. Was
this used as a workhouse by the parish? The amount paid
under the head of "Whitsun farthings" is described as
"Pentecostals to the dean and chapter, 2s. 3d." Every year
a regular charge of 1s. was made, as paid to the dean and
chapter's bailiff for what was termed "saddle silver." This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
was probably an annual payment for permission to the
inhabitants to pass on horseback over certain lands of the
dean and chapter. In many places a right of passing on
horseback is called "a bridle-way."</p>

<p>A bridge on the north side of the churchyard is mentioned
in 1683, and sums paid for bricks and masons' work to mend
the same, and for railing and posting it. What bridge was
this? Another curious circumstance recorded in this book
is, that in 1717 "Mrs. Margery Carwardine, late of this
parish, gave &pound;20, the interest of which yearly to be laid out
in Bibles for ever, to be delivered to the poorer sort of young
people every Easter who have best rehearsed the church
catechism in the Lent before; and if there be any overplus
it shall be layd out in catechisms to be given to poor children
yt go to the reading school." In the year 1702 it was
agreed in vestry meeting "that only one churchwarden should
be elected year by year, and to continue in his office two
years, viz., the first year as under churchwarden and the
second year as head churchwarden." The accounts of these
officers were regularly entered in the book by a professional
scribe, who was paid accordingly.</p>

with 1670, the register 1694, and the account book

to which the old parish church (formerly situate on the Upper
Quay) was exposed. Even the existing books seem to have
been thoroughly soaked, or else the ink used on them was
so pale as to be quite illegible in many places. Early in the
present century (as the Rev. John Davies, the incumbent,
informs me) during a great flood, he passed up the aisle of
the church in a boat, and for some weeks was obliged to
borrow another church to accommodate his parishioners.
An old tale is told in this parish that on one occasion a
clergymen found a salmon left by the subsidence of the
flood in St. Clement's church, and hence the presentation to
the living was supposed to include the valuable privilege of
catching all the fish that can be secured in this way. Fortunately
for the parishioners, there were but about a score of
them living on the side of the river where the old church
stood, while the remainder (about 2000) occupied a delightful
bank on the west side, where the effects of floods and dampness
are set at defiance, if we may judge from the many
instances of longevity occurring there. Only a few months
ago a person died there who remembered George III being
crowned; and another, still surviving, regularly walks up to
the communion-table with firm step, although upwards of
ninety years of age. Mr. Davies, who for forty years has
been the beloved and faithful pastor, has during that period
buried about 2000 persons, being in fact a whole generation
of the parish. But to return to the records.</p>

<p>In 1700, the sum of 8s is charged as "spent agoing the
bounds of the parish and a boat; at the same time, when
we came to Anthony Wall's, 10s 4d". Yet with all these
appliances of creature comforts, the then really onerous
office of churchwarden was considered so undesirable that,
as in other parishes, the persons selected to fill it sometimes
"bought themselves off" by a good round sum to the parish,
as was the case in 1776, when Mr John Williams paid five
guineas for that purpose The total disbursements of the
parish in 1695 amounted to &pound;86 18s 10d, out of which
&pound;55 15s 8d was paid to the poor; and the churchwardens
seem to have taken good care at most times to keep a
balance in hand Among the items of expenditure are&mdash;for
mending the church after the floods, for cloth and brass for
the poors' badges (See chapter on St Swithin's parish),
4d each for hedgehogs, &amp;c. The sacramental wine for the
whole year (1700) cost but 7s, and only 9s 10d was received
of the communicants during the twelve months In
1712 it was "agreed and ordered, that for every corps
either parishioner or residing in this p'ish that shal be
buried in this churchyard there shal sixpence be paid to
the churchwardens for ye time being toward ye mayntaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
of ye paling, and for every one brought out of any other
p'ish to be paid one shilling as aforesayd."</p>

<p>The church was "bewtifyed" in 1745, but it may be
reasonably supposed that no "bewtifycation" would long
resist the frequent irruption of Sabrina's waters (from which
the building had probably been protected by the old city
wall before the latter was destroyed); and accordingly in
1820 it was resolved to abandon the old fabric and build a
new one on the west side of the river, which was completed
in 1823. I gather from the records that the Whitsun
farthings paid by this parish in 1726 amounted to 7-1/2d.; and
as this oblation consisted of a farthing a head paid by every
householder to the mother church, it would seem that (unless
this was a fixed annual payment) only thirty householders
then subscribed in this parish; which is more a proof of
the smallness of the population at that time than of disaffection
for the church, as the latter was scarcely ever
permitted in those days to stand in the way of her legal
claims. Yet in 1779 there were 141 houses in the parish.
About eighty years ago, I am informed, St. Clement's and
All Saints' churches were served by the same minister&mdash;an
arrangement often made in those days of no discipline
and church desecration. It appears, however, that many
centuries ago, in a dispute about the advowson of this church,
which was then said to be dependent on All Saints, the bishop
declared it to be a free chapel, having no connection whatever
with All Saints.</p>

<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">This</span> register is likewise copied, from the year 1538
to the close of that century, in a good plain hand,
except during the Puritanic period, when the rough
scribbling of clerks or ill-educated ministers greatly disfigures
the book. Much confusion and extensive omissions also
occur from the year 1633 till after the Restoration, and
from 1749 to 1761, from which time, however, to the present
the register is regularly kept and in as good order as any
I have seen. The only curious entry in them is dated
January 24, 1736; when "Thomas, bastard son of Ann
Husel, was baptised. This Ann Husel was a common
strumpet, but pickt up and maintayned in a very gallant
manner by one Baker, a rakish spark of 3 or 400 a
year, by whom he had the bastard Thomas, as generally
supposed. They lived together as man and wife in defyance
of God and man, tho' under ye nose of ye Consistory Court,
at the Hill." A memorandum is likewise made of the following
benefactions, which I believe are still administered:
Mr. William Norton, in February, 1721, left lands to the
value of &pound;7 yearly, the rents and profits of which thus to be
distributed: "20s. every year to the minister for preaching
a sermon on such day of the month yearly as I shall be
buried;" 20s. in twopenny household bread to the poor who
should attend and hear the said sermon; and the residue
to clothe five poor men of the parish that usually attend
the church and also hear the above-named sermon. Mr.
William Swift also left houses and land to provide 12 penny
loaves of wheaten bread every Lord's day, and 24 more such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
loaves at Christmas Day, Easter, and Whit Sunday, to be
given to 12 poor aged people after service, and the overplus
to the minister. Another book records that St. George's
chapel, in this parish, was consecrated by Bishop Cornewall
on October 26, 1830, and the Rev. J. B. Tyrwhitt appointed
its minister by the Rev. E. W. Wakeman, then perpetual
curate of Claines.</p>

<p>The oldest account book commences with the year 1668.
Besides the churchwardens and overseers, two sidesmen,
supervisors of highways, and "destroyers of noisome fowls
and vermin," were regularly appointed. Foxes and urchins
still abound in this parish; and as to "noisome fowls," entries
frequently occur of sums paid for shooting kites, and in 1678
Sir J. Pakington's man was paid 1s. for killing a fox (<i>tempora
mutantur</i>). In regard to the appointment of churchwardens
there seems to have been a dispute between the incumbent
and the parishioners, as set forth in the following entry:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Mr. Phidkin, the curate, pretending a right, by virtue of the
canon, to elect a churchwarden, the parishioners procured an order
from the Consistory Court for the parishioners to meet, which they
accordingly did, and chose two new wardens, and made their return
to the said Court, but Mr. Phidkin insisted on the canon, and
prayed that the churchwardens should be sworn; but the chancellor
declaring that the court had not the power of trying the custom,
a mandamus was obtained at the King's Bench to swear the two
churchwardens elected by the parish."</p></div>

<p>It appears from another entry that the ancient custom was
"for the minister, together with the consent of the
parishioners, to choose the low churchwarden to be head
churchwarden for the year." The parochial officers&mdash;as was
the case in most parishes&mdash;were occasionally checked in their
tendency towards an extravagant expenditure, one of the
vestry meetings ordering that no more than 10s. should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
spent at the visitation, besides fees; no more than 2s. 6d. to
be allowed for ringing on any occasion; and only 2s. each
to the officers for attending Sessions. The perambulation
expenses in 1732 were &pound;1. 10s; three days were usually
occupied in beating the bounds, and they dined at the Tavern
(Query, the present Virgin's Tavern?). May day was likewise
kept as a festival, and money allowed in these accounts
for the celebration of it. In the year 1750 the principal
inhabitants, in vestry assembled, agreed to forfeit 40s. each
if they did not use their "utmost endeavour to put a stop to
the evil practices commonly committed on our wake Sunday."
The wake was held on Trinity Sunday; and notwithstanding
the above combination, old custom proved stronger than the
sense of propriety, for until within the last twenty or thirty
years the wake was continued, and I am told that some
extraordinary scenes were usually witnessed here: even on
the graves, travelling vagabonds plied their profession, and</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Many a youth the glittering snuff-box eyed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Paid for his stick forthwith and boldly shied."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Such scenes of fighting, drunkenness, and debauchery, were
probably never witnessed in the parish but at those times,
and close beneath the shadow of its old church too. The
clergy, aided by the indefatigable exertions of the present
respectable clerk, Mr. Williams, at length rooted out the
evil; and a little dancing which is still carried on at Fearnall
Heath on the Monday is all that remains of Claines wake.</p>

<p>The overseers in 1678 were ordered to deduct the third
part of the pay of such poor as should be found tippling in
alehouses upon Sundays, for the space of a month after they
should be found so tippling. Among the curious entries in
these books are the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1669.&mdash;"Given to one whose dwelling was drowned by the sea
coming too late to church, 1s."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>1713.&mdash;"Whereas several pack horses hath spoiled the road
leading from Dean Green to Claines Church, not having any right
to travel the said road, being no inhabitance of the said parish,
we order that there be a barr with post and railes set upp to prevent
it over against the house of Richard Onions."</p></div>

<p>An interesting document relative to the liability of Claines
to pay to the relief of the poor of the Tything of Whistones
will be found under the head of "County Sessions Records&mdash;The
Poor."</p>

<p>The Rev. W. Crowther is the present perpetual curate of
Claines; churchwardens, Mr. Moon and Mr. Martin Curtler.

<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> Sessions rolls, now in the custody of the Clerk of
the Peace, consisting of recognizances, presentments,
informations, memorials, grand jury bills, &amp;c., commence
with 1600, but the order books do not go further than
1693. From the latter it appears that a great portion of the
county business was transacted at inns and private gentlemen's
houses. The Talbot, in Sidbury, for a great number of years
enjoyed the magisterial patronage, adjournments being regularly
made from the Guildhall (where the County Assizes
and Sessions were then held) to that respectable old hostelry,
where no doubt the magnates compensated themselves for
the dry and tedious work in hand by generous and stimulating
potations, as was the custom with the city authorities. Several
Sessions were adjourned to Hooper's coffee-house at the
Guildhall, which is first mentioned in 1767 as being kept by
Lucy Hooper, and also to the Trinity Hall (an old building
occupied by various trading "companies" or "guilds," on the
site of which now stand Messrs. Freame's warehouses near
St. Swithin's church). A committee of magistrates were
ordered to inspect this hall in 1796, to consider the propriety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
of purchasing it and converting it into an office for the Clerk
of the Peace; but this seems to have fallen to the ground.
The Talbot, Claines (Tything), was preferred for some time,
the Star being occasionally used; then the Crown inn was
chosen in 1792 by a formal vote of the bench; and in the
early part of the present century the Hop-pole came in for
its share. During all this period, however, on many occasions,
adjournments were made to other towns and villages. The
Earl of Coventry was frequently visited in this way at
Croome; the Hon. H. Herbert, at Ribbesford (1710); Rev.
Dr. William Lloyd, at Ripple; William Hancock, Esq., at
Bredon's Norton, and the Bishop's Palace at Hartlebury
(1715); Lord Herbert, at Ribbesford (1721); and in 1723 a
circuit seems to have been taken on many consecutive days
to the Crown, Evesham; Crown, Blockley; George, Shipston;
Angel, Pershore; Talbot, Feckenham; Crown, Bromsgrove;
George, Bewdley; Lion, Kidderminster; Talbot, Stourbridge;
Bush, Dudley; Hundred House, Witley; Crown, Tenbury;
the house of Mrs. Collins, Shelsley; and the Sun, Upton.
By the statute 9th George I, chap. 24, all persons who were
Papists, and all persons who had not taken the oath for
securing the throne to the House of Hanover, were to do so
before the 25th of December, 1723, in one of the courts at
Westminster or at the Quarter Sessions. This was no doubt
the cause of the adjournments of the Quarter Sessions in that
year. In modern times it often occurs that the Quarter
Sessions are adjourned to different places in the county for
the convenience of newly-appointed magistrates being sworn
into office. In the year 1809, Sir Harry Lippincott, Bart.,
was appointed a magistrate for Gloucestershire, and he was
sworn into office at an adjournment of the Gloucestershire
Quarter Sessions&mdash;the Sessions being adjourned to the White
Lion, the principal inn at Berkeley (now the Berkeley Arms),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
the late Earl of Berkeley taking the chair, and administering
the oaths to the hon. bart. In 1697, Lancelott Jewkes, the
Worcester county gaoler, was fined &pound;20 "for not attending this
court to do his duty, the court having had several occasions
for him." It was ordered in 1716, "that the Sheriff for the
future do not return any freeholders within the burrough of
Bewdley to serve on jurys for the County Sessions, they
having Sessions of their own." Another order was made in
1723, "that there be an advertisement in the Worcester
newspaper, to give notice to people lyable to serve on jurys
not to give money to the bayliffe to excuse them, and that
the treasurer doe pay for the advertisement four weeks successively."

<p>In 1753, William Cooper, of Shipston, was fined &pound;5 for
taking money of William Taylor, of Armscot, to excuse his
serving upon the jury at Sessions. The only remaining
item under this head is an order made in 1789, "that at
all future Sessions, business be conducted only by counsel,
and not by attorneys as heretofore; but that in testimony
of the respect due to Wilson Aylesbury Roberts, Esq., for
his integrity and abilities, as well as for the regularity of his
attendance and the assistance this court has received from
him through a series of years, he is from henceforth received
and heard as our advocate or counsel, as if he was a barrister,
and as if the said order had been never made."</p>

<h3>Witchcraft.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/il-p078.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">Our</span> county records do not contain evidence of the
existence of this superstition to a great extent,
owing to the fact that witchcraft cases were usually
tried at the Assizes. The first instance occurring in the
Sessions rolls is in the year 1601, when Edward Buckland
"exhibited articles complaining of John Genifer, to whom
he had lent money," and when Buckland's "poor wife"
asked for it, Genifer used shocking language, and "charged
her with being a witch, and had deserved burning seven
years sithence, and if she was a midwife was not fitt to bringe
a &mdash;&mdash; to bed, much less a woman."</p>

<p>In 1633 the recognizance of widow Bellett, of Stony
Morton (?) was taken, to appear at the next Sessions, to
answer charges brought by William Vaughan, of Inkberrow,
and others. This document is in some places scarcely legible,
but it appears that the principal charge was "for the evil
artt that shee useth with the &mdash;&mdash; wich, and she gives &mdash;&mdash;
to finde out goodes lost, and using the name of Peter and
Paule therein in profane manner, beinge sayde to be &mdash;&mdash;
of that sleight &mdash;&mdash;." I found no account of her trial.</p>

<p>In May, 1660, the examination of Elinor Burt was taken
before Gervase Bucke and William Collins, Esqrs., and
"being examined whether she hath not taken upon her to
cure several persons afflicted with several diseases and distempers
in their bodyes, ansheareth and saith, that shee did
not take upon her soe to do, but confesseth that when
diverse had come to her that hath aches in their heads and
other infirmities, she had and hath a gifte from God, by good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
prayers and laying her hands upon their heads or faces,
oftentimes to recover and heal them of their diseases; and
being examined what other means she useth to recover sick
persons, saith, noe other means but good prayers; and further
doth not materially confess." As the Sessions order book
does not commence till 1693, there is no means of ascertaining
the result of this and other cases prior to that date which
are mentioned in this abstract of the records; but in the
same year (1660) it is stated that "Joane Bibbe was bound
for good behaviour for beinge of evil fame, and suspected
for wychcrafte, butt not as yet charged." This is undoubtedly
Joan Bibb, of Rushock, who (as stated in a MS. note-book of
Mr. Townsend, of Elmley Lovett, who was a county justice
at that time) "was tyed and thrown into a poole, as a witch
to see whether shee could swim." But she brought her
action against Mr. Shaw, the parson, for his share in this
transaction, and recovered &pound;10 damages, and Mr. Townsend
compounded for her and others with Mr. Shaw for &pound;20. The
same MS. records the bringing of four other persons from
Kidderminster that year, and ducking them in the Severn at
Worcester, but the details of their cases have already been
published by Nash.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Ranford, of Great Comberton, widow, lays an
information before the magistrates on the 26th of September,
1662, "that she heard Joane Willis, wife of Thomas Willis,
of Great Comberton, say that shee will take her oathe that
shee, the said informant, is a witch, and bewitched to death
one Thomas Right's wife and one Robert Price's child, both
of Comberton aforesaid; and that shee behegged one of the
said Joane Willis her children; likewise the said informant
informeth, that shee, the said informant, was gooing to one
Margaret Willis her house, in Comberton aforesaid, about
her business, and the said Joane Willis came violently upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
her and gave her several blows with a staffe, and ripped her
quaife of her head, and prophanely did swear, blood and
wounds shee would kill her."</p>

<p>In the month of August, 1666, Ann Powell, spinster, of
Kington, lays an information that "upon St. James's Day last
she and one Elizabeth Daffye, widow, having discours together
concerning Mary, the wife of Anthony Slater (being this
informer's dame), the said Elizabeth then told this informer,
in the presence and hearing of others of the neighbourhood,
that shee had late before had a heifer strangely amisse, and
supposing shee might be bewitched, she went to a telster or
wise woman (as shee termed her), who told her, the said
Elizabeth, that the said Mary, the wife of the said Anthony
Slater, had done the said heifer harm, meaning, as this
informer conceaveth, that the said Mary had bewitched the
said heifer; and further this informer sayth, that by reason
of the speaking of the said wordes, her said dame hath been
much scandalized in the neighbourhood, and several quarrels
and fighting between her and others of her neighbours have
ensued thereupon." Although unable to give the result of
this charge, the information will be sufficiently interesting
of itself, as affording us an insight to the state of society at
that time. Joseph Orford, of Oldswinford, nailer, was presented
in the year 1687, "for being a common disturber,
and for charging Thomas Barnes, a person of good repute,
with being guilty of witchcraft, and that he hath boasted that
he would have the said Barnes and his wife duckt for witches,
and he would procure one John Johnson, a drummer, to be
present at the doing it, to make the more sport." But here
comes a case with more curious detail.</p>

<p>At the Midsummer Sessions of 1698, Martha Farmer, of
Astley, deposed before Mr. James, a magistrate, that Margaret
Hill, of Shrawley, came to deponent's house about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
Midsummer three or four years ago, during her absence,
and required her child, who was only seven or eight years
old, to sell her some oaten meal, but as the child would not
do so in her mother's absence, "shee pluck'd the child to her
and hurt her finger, causing blood to come from it. In the
morning the child fell ill, and continued in a sickly manner
for some days, till a strange woman came to the dore and
told her the child was bewitched; and Margaret Hill was
sent for to come and pray over the child. She at first
refused, but at length being prevailed on, shee said her
prayers and the child recovered; but after some time it
relapsed into its former sicknesse, and lay screeching and
crying." Margaret Hill was sent for the second time, but
would not come till after she had been "threatened by
Farmer that if the child died she would have life for life.
Then shee prayed by the child, which recovered, and continued
well." During the child's illness Hill's daughter came
to the deponent's house and offered to go for a doctor, and
returned the same day, bringing some water in a bottle to
cure a surfeit which she said the child had, and desired her
not to be angry, for if her mother had injured the child she
was sorry for it. Ann Farmer also deposed that when she
went to fetch Margaret Hill "the latter called her a Judas
b&mdash;&mdash;, and told her she should not be well whilst she lived,
whereupon she fell lame, and continues to be soe, beinge
fairly persuaded that Margaret Hill was the occasion of her
lameness." Mary Wall made oath that "Margaret Hill
came to her house and begged for butter-milk, but she had
none, and the same afternoon the cow which gave the milk
fell ill, and they sent for a man skilled in distempered cattle,
who told her that the cow was bewitched; whereupon they
sent for Margaret Hill, who came and prayed over the cow.
My husband went to a wiseman at Worcester, who said his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
cow would be dead before he got home (and it was soe), and
told him to keepe all suspected persons out of his house.
Some time before the cow died, Margaret Hill came and
asked witness whether her husband was gone for help for
the cow, although they had not informed her of his going."
Margaret Powell gave evidence that "7 or 8 years ago
Margaret Hill came to buy half a qtn. tobacco, and was
refused to trust her, when shee asked witness if shee had any
piggs; and going where they were, the piggs began foaming
and tumbling about and died." Catherine Jones deposed
that the accused "also came to her house 3 years ago to buy
a peck of corn, but could not agree as to price, and presently
afterwards deponent had a calf fell ill, lingered, and dyed."
So damning a body of proof, it may fairly be presumed, was
too much for poor Mrs. Hill, but I find no record of the
result, the case having probably been tried at the Assizes,
the rolls of which court, I suppose, are in London. More
particulars respecting witchcraft in this county will be found
further on in this volume.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">From</span> the earliest period to which the county rolls
refer, the constables and churchwardens were charged
to present in the Sessions all persons who regularly
absented themselves from the service of the church and
would not receive the sacrament, all innkeepers who made
charges above the scale allowed, all tipplers and houses where
tippling was allowed during divine service, to report whether
due watch and ward was kept and all vagabonds duly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
punished; besides a variety of other returns. The beerhouse
nuisance was even at that time the most fertile
generator of crime. In 1602 one Edward Pearce was charged
for that, "in November last past, he with one other of his
companions were eatinge of fresherings with two women in
an alehouse in Inkberrow, and when they had done, Pearce
went to his chamber and did set a candle lighted in his
window, and when he returned he said that he had done as
the scollers in Oxforde did when they meant to doe aney
exployt, to light a candle, that they might be thought to be
at their book; and thereupon he and his companion in the
night went abroade into the field with the two women very
suspiciously;" it was also alleged that they set some corn
on fire, and "riotously drew drink in kettles and drank it
with apples;" and that Pearce drank so long and so hard
that a catastrophe occurred which cannot be mentioned
here; lastly, that about the same time he went into an
alehouse and called for drink, and because the landlady did
not make haste he laid her on the fire. A memorial signed
by nineteen inhabitants of Bayton was sent to the Sessions
in the year 1612, setting forth "that John Kempster and
Thomas Byrd do not sell their ale according to the law,
but doe sell a pynte for a penny, and doe make ytt
soe extraordynarye strong that itt draweth dyvers ydle
p'sons into the said alehouses, by reason whereof sondrye
assaults, affrayes, blodshedds, and other misdeameanors,

which doe thither resort and there contyneue in their
dronckenes three dayes and three nights together, and also
divers men's sonnes and servants do often resort and contineue
drinking in the said houses day and night, whereupon divers
disorders and abuses are offered to the inhabitants of Bayton
aforesaid, as in pulling down styles, in carrying away of yertes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
in throwing men's waynes, plowes, and such like things, into
pooles, wells, and other bye places, and in putting their yokes
for their oxen into lakes and myery places," &amp;c. A nice
picture of young England in the seventeenth century. In the
same year (1612) Henry Cartlage was presented "for hanging
a pair of horns at the door of Kenelm Gritt, at Bromsgrove,
insinuating that he was a cuckold," and for other bad actions.
It was a very general custom in the middle ages to signalize
the unhappy husbands of false women by means of horns.
The origin of the custom has always been a matter of dispute.
In an old ballad, called "The Merry Humours of Horn Fair,"
are these lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The parson's wife rides with the miller;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She said, I hate horns I do declare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet happy are the men who wear them,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My husband he shall have a pair."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Corn Market in Worcester was the usual scene for
whipping and using the pillory, as well for county as city
prisoners, and from twelve to two o'clock on the market day
(Saturday) the time generally chosen, for the sake of publicity.
Mary and Elizabeth Squire, <i>alias</i> Skamp (!) were ordered to
be whipped there in 1710; and the regular instructions, for
women as well as men, were "to be whipped on their backs
till they be bloody." On some occasions these floggings took
place through the streets, as in 1732, when John Potter was
"whipt at the cart's tail from College gate to the liberty-post
in the Foregate Street," for a felony. This liberty-post stood
at the north east corner of Salt Lane. At other times they
were whipped from the bridge to the liberty-post in St. John's.
On October 7th of the same year it was "ordered that the
sentence passed on Richard Baylis, John Lawer, and Edward
Jones, touching their being as this day putt in the pillory, be
respited till next Saturday, the Corporation of the city of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
Worcester having taken down the pillery, and there being not
time to get one erected to putt them in the pillery this day."
In 1765 two guineas were paid to Mr. Baxter, the Under
Sheriff, for erecting a pillory; and in 1797, Thomas Wilkinson
was sentenced to the pillory in the Corn Market "for
obtaining 4s. from John Waterson, miller, of Salwarpe, on
pretence that he was an inspector for printing the prices of
grinding in the said mill."</p>

<p>At Bromsgrove, men and women were whipt in the market
place; and at Upton, from the bridge to the turnpike gate
leading from thence to Gloucester. At the latter town, in
1737, John Willoughby and Adam Cook were presented for
removing and carrying away the prison house or gaol belonging
to the town! The circumstances of this very singular charge
are not detailed, but the presentment was quashed.</p>

<h3>The Gaol.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/il-p085t.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> first mention made of the state of the county
gaol was in 1616, when a petition was sent to the
Quarter Sessions from the poor debtors confined
therein "against various hard usages, exactions, and extortions
offered to prisoners by Mrs. Moore, the keeper," and
"when one of the justices took pains to amend it she obeyed
him not but used more extremities." Mrs. Moore, however,
commenced a cross fire, by petitioning the magistrates at the
same time, alleging that her late husband had "taken the
gaol upon a very great and extreme <i>rent</i>," and she and her
husband had "given trust and credit to many poor distressed
prisoners, hoping of satisfaction at their enlargement," but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
since the death of her husband divers persons had run into
debt, and had brought false articles of accusation against her
to shield themselves. Her plea was <i>ad misericordiam</i>&mdash;that
she was "an unprotected female" since the death of her
husband, and was persecuted by the very parties to whom
she had shown kindness. But unfortunately the lady's allegations
were not borne out by fact, for Mr. Fleete, the justice
above-named, who had been commissioned to inquire into
the matter, caused Mrs. Moore to be bound in &pound;100 "to sell
an ale quart of beare for a penie" from that time forward,
as it appeared that she had been in the habit of selling the
prisoners ale by wine measure, and otherwise so managing
her retail business, that for a hogshead of drink which cost her
but 12s., she received 32s. Moreover she "tormented those
that were of mean condition (i.e., who could not afford to buy
her ale) with double irons." So Mr. Fleete ordered this to
be discontinued, and that the debtors should be separated
from the felons. Nevertheless, next year (1617) out comes
the following "Humble petition of the pore prisoners in the
Castle of Worcester, humbly showeth unto your good worships
that they are many pore men, to the number of thirty
prisoners and upwards, who lye there, some upon their
behavior, and the most parte of the reste upon matters
of small or noe value, having nothinge but the bare allowance
of a penie a day to relieve their faintinge bodyes, so that yf
they should be inforced to lye longer in this miserable place
wold unchristianlike be starved to death with hunger, cold,
and nakedness; some of them alsoe having many pore
children like to be left to the wide world. May yt therefore
please your good worships to consider them, to have their
present triall before your good worships, who rather desire to
be out of the world than to indure the misery wherein they
now are, and your petitioners will ever pray for your
worships' health."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>A system under which a gaoler rents his prison, and makes
his profit by selling drink to the inmates at an enormous rate,
reads curiously enough in these days when the science of
prison discipline has so greatly advanced as to induce us to
make the most costly sacrifices. It will be observed that
the county prison was on the site of the ancient castle, once
standing near the Cathedral precincts, but which had long been
destroyed. An order was made in 1723, "that Mr. Hall, the
treasurer, doe take due care that the partition be made in
the women's ward, in order to keep the debtors from the
felons." In 1767 the Clerk of the Peace was directed to
apply to the Treasury for the grant of "a certain piece of
garden ground, about five acres, lying contiguous to the
public gaol of the county, and particularly serviceable to the
occupiers thereof for the time being, and also the site and
remains of the old castle or citadel of Worcester, which now
is and hath long been used as a public gaol or prison and
bridewell for the said county," and praying that the grant
of the premises be made to the Earl of Plymouth, Lord
Coventry, Lord Sandys, Lord Ward, and other magistrates,
including the names of Lygon, Rushout, Winnington, and
Dowdeswell, "in trust, for the keeping of prisoners and
otherwise for the use and benefit of this county." A
petition was, however, transmitted to the Lords of the
Treasury, by the mayor and aldermen of the city, against the
grant of the site of these fortifications to the county magistrates,
and the city authorities were successful in the application.
This seems to have been the first effort made towards
gaol improvement, but the period was near at hand when
the outraged laws of health were to vindicate themselves.
The Worcester county prison, with several others in the
midland counties, in the year 1783, was visited with the fatal
gaol distemper, which swept the cells of their inhabitants and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
proved fatal to that eminent physician, Dr. Johnstone. At
that period I find an order on the book "to apply to the
sheriff for his concurrence to fix a temporary gaol, and
endeavour by advertisement and otherwise to find one or
more proper places for the confinement of felons." Extensive
improvements were set on foot, in which the humane system
suggested by the philanthropist Howard was introduced, and
when the works were finally completed (in 1795) a sum of
between &pound;4000 and &pound;5000&mdash;a large amount for that period&mdash;had
been expended. In 1785, William Lygon, Esq., was
thanked "for his great trouble in procuring the removal of a
number of transports from the county gaol on board the
lighters on Thames, whereby the county was saved a considerable
expense and the health of the gaol was preserved."
About four years afterwards, and while the alterations were
still going on, an order was made not to confine any one in
the dungeon of the gaol nor to confine any two prisoners in
one cell. The spirit of reform, however, was not yet satisfied,
for scarcely had the century closed when it was found that
the great outlay that had been incurred was useless, and that
the establishment was altogether insecure; William Davis,
the gaoler, complaining of the escape of certain prisoners;
and a "watchman or guard" was decided on. After an unprecedented
opposition on the score of expense, and a protracted
scene of strife and contention among the magistracy, the
Court of Quarter Sessions at length resolved, in the year
1808 (but not till Lord Chief Baron Macdonald had threatened
the county with a heavy fine), to build a new gaol in Salt
Lane, at a cost of &pound;18,000. The details of these transactions
will be found in "Worcestershire in the Nineteenth Century,"
recently published, the author of which informs us that on
the Sunday during or immediately following the Assizes, which
used to be known as Assize Sunday, and kept as a great fair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the keepers at the (old) county gaol were accustomed to show
the prisoners through the bars to the curious crowd, and
collect money in a boot for pointing out those who were sentenced
to be hanged! In 1814 the prisoners were removed
to the new gaol; and at the very next Sessions, Mr. Wells,
attorney, was requested to apply to Mr. Sandys, the architect,
relative to the escape of some prisoners therefrom!! From
that time to the present this ill-fated building has seemed
destined to an endless sinking of capital, for the trial of new
experiments and for remedying the stupidity of bygone architects
and committees. About &pound;18,000 was spent on it a
dozen years ago, and now (1856) nearly &pound;20,000 has been
voted for the same purpose.</p>

<h3>The Poor.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/il-p089w.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capm"><span class="smcap">When</span> the Monasteries were dissolved by Henry VIII,
the first authorised parochial machinery was established
for the relief of the poor and for suppressing
vagrancy. An act was passed authorising the head officers of
every parish to receive and keep all poor applicants, putting
the able-bodied to constant labour. The necessary funds were
to be derived from voluntary contributions collected by the
officers, and also the proceeds of stimulating sermons in
the churches. But the voluntary system proved a failure, and
it was left for Elizabeth to introduce the principle of compulsory
taxation for this purpose. The statute 43rd Elizabeth,
chap. 2, was kept in full operation till the passing of the
Poor-law Amendment Act, in 1834. In the time of Elizabeth,
cottage building for the poor was an object of great jealousy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
to the inhabitants of towns and villages, who dreaded the
location of paupers amongst them, and took immense pains
to "pass on" any mendicants who happened to stray within
their boundary. Officers were usually appointed to "remove
intruders," and these knowing "porrochials" would not infrequently
offer a bribe when no other means had availed for
ejecting the obnoxious tramp from a parish. By an act
(31 Eliz.) it was declared that "no cottage should be erected
unless there be four acres of ground of their own freehold
to be continually used therewith." The operation of this
statute was often attended with great 'privation and suffering
to the poor, and the Sessions Rolls of this county
abound with petitions and memorials to the bench on the
subject. In 1612, William Dench, labourer, of Longdon, in
his petition, set forth that "being destitute of habitation, and
having a wife and seven small children, William Parsons, of
Longdon, in charity took him to live in a little sheepcot of his
in the said towne, with the consent of the churchwardens and
overseers; but because yr poor orator (the usual term for
"petitioner") had not licence in open Quarter Sessions, nor
under the hands and seals of the lords of the manor, and
because the said sheepcot standeth on the freehold of William
Parsons, and not on the waste, contrary to the act 43rd
Elizabeth, chap. 2, therefore he was indicted and is sued to
an outelary (outlawry), petitions for pardon and for a licence
to continue in the said sheepcot."</p>

<p>The Worcester County Quarter Sessions, 1660, made an
order that all cottages erected since the late war should be
"pluckt downe" as a "greate grievance," and that no house-room
should be provided for "lusty young married people,"
who, if they unwisely married before they had got houses,
were told to "<i>lye under an oke</i>." A few years previously,
one Corbett, a Parliamentary soldier, settled at Brickle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>hampton,
and purchased half-an-acre of land to build a house
upon. The parishioners, it seems, were content, but the
lord of the manor refused. On application to the Sessions,
leave was granted to build.</p>

<p>Two years later, in consequence of great complaints of the
country being much burdened and impoverished, the magistrates
ordered that the constables should cause every parish
to be surveyed and inspected as to how many cottages (and
under what conditions) had been erected during the last
forty years. It had also been ordered that every person
apprehending a vagrant, and bringing him to a constable
or tithingman, should have 12d. a piece for them&mdash;this step
being considered necessary in consequence of "the great
charge of wandering beggars and the efforts made in other
counties to reduce them." Many persons were indicted for
erecting cottages without having the necessary quantity of
land attached; their cottages were pulled down, and all their
little substance destroyed. Poor people were driven to herd
together, great numbers in one house, or to sleep in sheds
and in the open air; and thus a law which was intended to
suppress mendicancy resulted in great suffering to the lower
classes, and undoubtedly to the engendering of filth, disease,
and crime. So scrutinizing were the precautions against a
liability to support the poor, that no person who belonged to
that unfortunate class could travel out of his parish into
another, and accept employment and a lodging there, without
a certificate from the churchwardens and overseers of his
own parish that in case he should ever require relief they
would take him back. The following memorials are sad
pictures of poverty and suffering in the seventeenth century:</p>

<p>In the parish records of Claines (now in the churchwardens'
chest of that church) an allusion to this petition is entered on
one of the account books, to this effect, that upon the complaint
of the inhabitants of the hundred of Oswaldslow, of the great
burthen of the poor of the Tything of Whistones, alleging that
the same township was in the town of Claines, an examination
into the facts was intrusted to the Lord Windsor, Sir E.
Dineley, and others, when the inhabitants of Claines showed
that the township of Whistones was an ancient township, and
had "parishtionall officers" to themselves, and was not in
the parish of Claines, but anciently had its own church, and
that the township was never included in the parish of Claines,
and that the poor there had received relief of the hundred
from time immemorial&mdash;at least from the time of King James&mdash;and
never from Claines; that it had been questioned in the
time of King James, but could never be shown that Claines
had paid to their poor. The Court thereupon would not alter
proceedings observed for so long a time, and discharged
Claines from the said poor, except by paying its share as a
part of the said hundred.</p>

<p>Another handwriting on the same document records that,
"Upon examination of the above-named Seamour I finde
nothing of truth in the above letter, neyther that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
banished by Cromwell, nor that he hath ever been in West
Indies, or that he landed in Wales; but this I find that he
hath been a wanderer almost all over England, and knoweth
most men of any quallitie in the kingdom, and hath changed
his name so oft that he hath almost forgot it. It is also
reported that he hath one wife at Harford, with another at
Bristol"&mdash;(the remainder of the document is destroyed).</p>

<p>It appears by another that Seamour informed Mr. Charlton
that he had been "<i>the king's tutor and bedfellow for seven
years, and had preached the late king's funeral sermon</i>!"
The art of impudence could not much further go; and it is
probable, by an information being laid at the Sessions, that
the fellow received his reward, but the books containing
convictions and sentences of that date are not in existence.</p>

<p>In 1698, however, I find on the books that "Wm. Bilson,
for wandring abroad with a false letter of request, p'tending
a ffire at Icomb, be publicly whipt on Saturday next." Five
years later it was "ordered, for the carrying of vagrants,
that the constable be allowed 2d. per mile for one horse, and
by the same proportion for two or three horses, or if a teame
having three or more horses, then to allow them 6d. per
mile, and to allow the passengers 5d. per head for their night's
lodging and necessaries." In 1714 an order "touching the
settlement of Ann Guise" was quashed on the ground of
"there being no such place as Leye-Shinton." The magistrates'
geographical knowledge must have been somewhat
limited if they were unaware of the existence of a place
but five miles off. It is probable, however, there was some
legal technicality in the matter, and that Leigh Sinton, which
is only a hamlet or place in the parish of Leigh, had been
represented as a parish of itself, which the bench could not
admit. I now give an interesting document relative to the
mode of proving a pauper's settlement in 1738:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>"Upon the appeal of the churchwardens and overseers of the
poor of the parish of Camden, in the county of Gloucester, to an
order of removal of Mary Calcott from the parish of Kingsnorton,
in the said county of Worcester, it appeared to this court, upon
the examination of the said Mary Calcott, taken upon her oath
in court, that the said Mary Calcott was, upon All Saint's Day,
in the yeare of our Lord 1735, hired with John Ellis, of Camden,
chapman, for a year, to spin with yarn, at the rate of 1s. 6d. a
stone, and that she was to provide herself with meat, drink, washing,
and lodging, where she pleased, and that she spunn for him the
whole year, and lodged in her said master's house, and boarded with
him at Camden, and received 1s. 6d. a stone for her work, allowing
her master 2s. 6d. per week for her lodging and board. And upon
her examination she said that by her said contract as aforesaid
she thought she was not at liberty to work for any other master,
but she thought she was at liberty to play or be absent from her
work as long as she pleased, being to be paid att a certain rate
for her work done. Wherfore it is the opinion of this court that
the said hyring and service aforesaid was not sufficient to gain for
the said Mary Calcott a settlement in the parish of Camden, and
this court doth accordingly reverse the said order of removal."</p></div>

<p>A refusal to serve the office of overseer by a resident of
the Cathedral precincts (in the year 1804) may be unknown
to the present inhabitants of that locality, to whom it will
prove interesting:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I, Francis Stafford, one of the sextons of the Cathedral Church
of Christ and the blessed Mary the Virgin of Worcester, do
hereby give you and each of you, and all others whom it may concern,
notice that I shall appeal to the next general Quarter Sessions
of the Peace, to be holden at the Guildhall of the city of Worcester,
against the nomination and appointment made by you under your
hands and seals, and bearing date July, 1804, whereby you nominated
and appointed me by the name and description of 'Francis
Stafford, a substantial householder of the vill and hamlet of the
precincts of the Cathedral Church of Christ and the blessed Mary
the Virgin of Worcester, in the county of Worcester, to be overseer
of the said vill and hamlet;' and be pleased to take notice, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the grounds of my appeal are&mdash;that the said precincts are not nor
never were reputed to be a vill and hamlet, nor a place for which
an appointment of overseer is directed by law. And further, that
the said precincts are not, nor were, nor at any time have been
reputed to be, a vill, village, hamlet, or township, nor a place for
which an appointment of overseer is directed by law.</p>

<p class="center">"Witness my hand, &amp;c.,

<p class="right">"FRANCIS STAFFORD.</p>

<p>
"T. Dowdeswell, Esq., and<br />
"Henry Salmon, clerk."<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The order for the appointment was quashed at the October
Sessions of the same year. Exemption from the interruption
of the civil powers was what all the great monastic establishments
sooner or later obtained, but that of Worcester had
a long struggle with the hereditary sheriffs of the county
before its immunity from their officers could be obtained. The
Reformation introduced great changes, and the precincts of
the Cathedral became part of the outer county, but still they
remain independent of the city or county interior, being a
separate district under the superintendence of the Dean and
Chapter.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">In</span> no one particular does the contrast between the
present times and those of which we are treating
appear more marked, or the progress of society
more decided, than in the interference of the ruling
powers of olden times with various descriptions of trades
and occupations. There were the assizes or ordinances
regulating the price of bread, ale, fuel, and other common
necessaries of life; they clipped or expanded servants' and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
workmen's wages; prohibited or encouraged by bounties the
growth of various articles of consumption; adjusted carriers'
charges and the numbers of horses they might use up certain
hills; permitted the sale of many things only by license;
and otherwise sadly dammed up the current of human
progression within their own narrow channel. As regards
servants' wages, it would appear that the scale allowed early
in the seventeenth century was far from illiberal, for in the
year 1613 the authorities of Broadway petitioned "that
servants' wages be rated according to the statute in that
case, for we find it a great grievance in this county the
unreasonableness of servants' wages, so that they have grown
proud and idle." The rates for wages for servants and
labourers fixed in 1663 were as follows:</p>

<p>In 1731 it was ordered "that printed advertisements be
publicly sett upp in all publick places that the wages and
rates of servants and labourers be the same as last year,
except masons, who are allowed 14d. a day."</p>

<p>The corn trade was an object of special attention. An
instance of the great want of agricultural statistics occurs in
the year 1631, when the subjoined imperious missive was
received by the Worcestershire magistrates from the government
officials at Whitehall. This document will probably
be considered confirmatory of the experience derived from
history&mdash;namely, that whether a state undertakes to buy for
the people what they may want for their consumption, or
regulates the trade by interfering with the supply, it is immaterial
as to the result. In either case the people may expect
to be starved whenever corn is scarce:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"We cannot but very greatly merveile (marvel) that notwithstanding
his Majesty's proclamation and book of orders and the
diverse earnest letters of this Board, the price of corne and other
graine is risen so high, and the same sold at such excessive rates
in many places; neyther can wee conceave how this can be if the
directions sent from hence had been duly executed; you are therfore
to take notice that wee expect a more careful performance
thereof and a more particular account then hath hitherto been given
us, and accordingly wee do hereby, in his Majesty's name, expressly
charge you to cause presently a diligent and exact survey to be
made through all that county, what provisions of graine there is,
and to returne to this Board a certificate thereof with all expedition,
and likewise to see the markets well served according to
the orders, and not forestalled by greedy engrossers, to the intollerable
wrong and prejudice of those that are to buy, especially of
the poorer sort. You are likewise to use your best care and
endeavour that during the continuance of this present dearth the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>

<p>In 1715 it was ordered "that Richard Carwardine, of
Castle Morton, have a licence to be a comon badger of corne
for one year;" and in 1732, "that Thomas Wadley, of
Hanley Castle, have a licence granted him to be a common
badger, buyer, seller, and carrier, of all sorts of corn and
grain in any fair or market within this kingdom of England,
so that the same continue in force but for one year from the
date hereof and no longer." These badgers of corn were
persons who bought corn to sell again. By the statute
5th Elizabeth, chap. 12, they were compelled to take out an
annual licence from the Quarter Sessions. At the present
time, persons who go round to the farms and cottages in the
neighbourhood of Monmouth to buy poultry and bring it for
sale to the market at Monmouth are called "badgers."</p>

<p>In pursuance of an act passed in 1769, weekly returns of
the prices of wheat, rye, barley, oats, and beans, were
ordered from Bewdley, Kidderminster, Stourbridge, Dudley,
and Bromsgrove; and the following persons were instructed
to furnish such returns: Timothy Clare, stationer, Bewdley;
John Fawcett, weaver, Kidderminster; Robert West, stationer,
Stourbridge; Oliver Dixon, mercer, Dudley; and
George Wall, skinner, Bromsgrove.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the same century many convictions
took place "for selling loaves of bread without imprinting
on them the letter W in Roman capital, the said loaves not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
being rasped either before or after the bespeaking or purchasing
thereof, against the form of the statute." Ordered
(in 1710) "that Wm. Dimock, of Bishampton, have a licence
for a comon higler, lader, kedder, carrier, buyer, and seller,
of hens, chickens, capons, eggs, butter, cheese, ffish, and all
other dead vittualls, except pheasants, hares, and partridges."
The Clerk of the Peace was instructed in 1730 "to give notice
by public advertisement in the Worcester newspaper for all
carriers in the said county to attend this Court at the
adjourned Sessions, in order to settle the price of carriages,
according to the form of the statute in that case made and
provided." It was likewise ordered "that no common
waggoner or carrier shall take for carrying any goods to or
from Bewdley to London the sum of more than 7s. per cwt.
till further order." And in 1752, "that every waggon or
other carriage drawn up from the signe of the White Hart,
Broadway, to the top of the hill, so far as in the county of
Worcester, may be drawn with ten horses if the owner shall
think proper." Ditto, up the Malvern Hill, with seven.
Tolerably suggestive this of queer roads and stiff gradients.
The rates of carriage to be charged by carriers were fixed
by the Quarter Sessions under the statute 3rd William and
Mary, chap. 12, sec. 24, and the number of horses by which
carts and waggons were to be drawn was regulated by the
statute 5th George I, chap. 12.</p>

<p>Large quantities of salt were from time to time lost in the
Severn, as the vessels laden with that commodity were making
their way down the river from Worcester, owing to strong
tides and violent winds; and the rolls record frequent applications
to the Court "for certificates to entitle them (the
owners) to such allowance as the act of Parliament permits."
These allowances were no doubt the return of a part or the
whole of the very heavy duty then levied on salt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>By the 21st George III, chap. 58, and 26th George III,
chap. 43, certain bounties were offered for the cultivation of
hemp and flax. Nevertheless, England has never grown a
sufficient quantity for its own consumption, farmers not
regarding it with favour, owing to the supposed exhaustive
nature of the crop. In Worcestershire, for 1782 and some
following years, claims were made (and allowed by Quarter
Sessions) for these bounties, by&mdash;</p>

<p>From 1787 to 1792 the Worcestershire claims for flax
bounty amounted to &pound;79. 8s. 10d., and these were allowed.</p>

<p>Tobacco also was an article of which the Court of Quarter
Sessions took cognisance, and some interesting particulars
relative to the growth and suppression of "the weed" in
Worcestershire will be found in another part of this work.</p>

<p>In the year 1670 the grand jury presented Henry Sandalls,
bailiff of Bewdley, "who hath toll of the market, for upholding
unjust measures;" Elias Arch, bailiff of Kidderminster, ditto;
Thomas Foley, Esq., "who receives the benefit of the toll of
Stourbridge, for not providing a brass measure according to
act of Parliament, and for not making the measures of the
town according to the same; and that the justices do take
into consideration the great abuse that the people of this
county which resort to this city of Worcester to market do
receive by unjustness of the measures, and by the jogging
and shaking of the same;" and suggesting various rewards
for the capture of several known offenders.</p>

<p>About the year 1747 a terrible distemper broke out amongst
horned cattle, which all the vigilance of the authorities could
not prevent from spreading. The Worcestershire Bench first
ordered "that 4s. per week be allowed to the several turnpikes
where it shall be thought necessary in order to have a
man sitt up every night to watch the sayd turnpikes, that no
horned cattle be permitted to goe through the sayd turnpikes
without propper certificates be first showne, and surveyors
of the severall turnpikes to appoint propper persons to watch
at the said turnpikes, the expense to be paid by the county."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
Next year it was ordered "that Grey Devy, of Kingswinford,
be appointed inspector for the hundred of Halfshire in relation
to infected cattle, to take care that no infected cattle be
brought into any parish of the said hundred, and persue the
order of counsel made for preventing the spreading the infection
amongst the horned cattle; and to be allowed 7s. a week till
further order." In 1750 the distemper still raged, especially
in the adjoining county of Salop, and the magistrates licensed
"Edmund Lechmere, of Hanley Castle, Esq., to buy and sell
cattle at any fair, market, or place, where the buying or
selling of cattle is not prohibited, and to drive, sell, or dispose
of them, at any other fair, market, or place, as aforesaid,
tho' he shall not have obtained the certificate directed by
the said court, the said Edmund Lechmere having entered
into a recognizance with two suretys, according to the directions
of the said act" (of the previous Session). Many other
similar licenses were afterwards granted, and the constables
were ordered to prevent all persons not having such licenses
from driving cattle to fairs, nor was any person allowed to
bring cattle into the county without a certificate of their
freedom from disease. The Clerk of the Peace was also
ordered to procure 600 copies of an abstract of a certain
treatise on the distemper, with a prescribed method of cure,
by an eminent physician in Worcester, and distribute them
to the chief constables and inspectors in this and the adjoining
counties of Salop and Warwick. The <i>cordon sanitaire</i> was
relaxed in 1751, but the following year the distemper broke
out in this county with great severity, and vigilance was again
renewed. A meeting having been advertised for buying and
selling cattle at Beoley, the Sessions ordered that the meeting
be prohibited, the distemper being at Kingsnorton, and that
it be advertised in the Worcester and Birmingham journals,
and notice given in Beoley church. It was not till July,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
1756, that the distemper entirely abated, and all orders were
rescinded.</p>

<p class="drop-capm"><span class="smcap">We</span> now come to a class of items chiefly connected with
ecclesiastical control over matters both secular and
religious&mdash;instances of the exercise of power by
the Church for the punishment of offenders against her
discipline. Every reader of history is acquainted with the
force and effect of excommunication in the middle ages. By
a sentence of excommunication, both greater and less, the
victims were excluded from the right of Christian burial,
from bringing or maintaining actions, from becoming attorneys
or jurymen, and were rendered incapable of becoming witnesses
in any cause. Long before the Reformation the
frequency and abuse of this ecclesiastical weapon proved both
a scandal and a disadvantage to the Church, by bringing the
practice in some degree into contempt; and in the thirteenth
century many applications were made to the king complaining
of the resistance of excommunicated offenders who defied the
utmost that the Church could do to reduce them to submission.
In 1289, John, vicar of Feckenham, was excommunicated
by Godfrey, Bishop of Worcester, who appealed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
same manner for secular aid. When the nation reformed its
religion, the power of excommunication was still retained by
the Church, and is in force even to the present day, although
modified by the 53rd of George III, chap. 127, which restricts
the maximum term of imprisonment in all such cases to six
months. (See more on this subject under the head of St.
Nicholas' parish.) Obstinately refusing to attend divine service
in the parish church, incontinency, contumacy in not
appearing when cited in the Consistory Court, brawling, and
scolding&mdash;these were the principal offences for the punishment
of which the Church most frequently put forth her
power, as also on Quakers and Popish recusants.</p>

<p>I am sorry to be compelled to state that the first example
occurring in these rolls is that of a female scold. In 1614,
Margaret, wife of John Bache, of Chaddesley, was presented
to the Sessions as "a comon skould and a sower of strife
and disorder amongste her neyghboures, and hath bynn presented
for a skoulde at the leete houlden for the manour of
Chadsley, and for misbehavyng her tonge towards her mother-in-law
at a vysytacon (visitation) at Bromsgrove, April 29,
1603, and was excommunicated therefore." In 1617, one
Elinor Nichols was presented "as a great scold and mischief
maker, who is said to have been excommunicated and had
never applied to make her peace with the Church." The
usual mode of punishing this class of offenders was, however,
by the cucking-stool. A valued correspondent, in commenting
upon the details of the gum-stool, or cucking-stool, and other
punishments mentioned at pages 110 and 111 of "Worcester
in Olden Times" (in which an engraving is given of a curious
instrument of torture still hanging on the wall of Worcester
Guildhall), says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The gum-stool is evidently the cucking-stool, though it never
occurred to me that Cooking Street was really Cucking Street, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
had had its name spelt Cucken in old maps, as you state. The term
cuckold-stool is inaccurate, as this punishment is for scolding to the
common nuisance of the neighbourhood, and has no reference to
conjugal infidelity. The cucking-stool is the legal punishment of
the criminal offence of scolding; and if a woman had been indicted
and convicted of this offence at the last Assizes, the learned judge
must have sentenced her to the cucking-stool. The common scold
(<i>Communis Rixatrix</i>)&mdash;for the law confines it to the feminine gender&mdash;is
a public nuisance to her neighbourhood, and may be indicted for
the offence, and upon conviction punished by being placed on a
certain engine of correction called the trebucket, or cucking-stool;
and she may be convicted without setting forth the particulars in
the indictment, though the offence must be set forth in technical
words and with convenient certainty; and the indictment must
conclude not only against the peace but to the common nuisance of
her majesty's liege subjects. It is not necessary to give in evidence
the particular expressions used: it is sufficient to prove generally
that the defendant is always scolding. The skimmington is a mock
procession got up in derision of a woman who has beaten her
husband. You will find it in Hudibras. When a boy, I saw a skimmington,
and in it a man dressed in woman's clothes, who rode on
horseback behind a stuffed figure of a man, carrying a ladle, with
which the supposed woman kept beating the stuffed figure about the
head. This, too, has no reference to conjugal infidelity. But in
Wilts and Berks there is a mock procession that does relate to conjugal
infidelity; but this is called a 'Woosset,' which is pronounced
'Oosset'. It is a rough band followed by a person bearing a long
pole, with a cross-bar across it, on which is placed a shirt, and at
the top of the pole is a horse's skull with a pair of bull's horns
attached to it. This I have also seen. I have omitted to mention
that cucking-stools were of two kinds&mdash;the one fixed, the other
moveable. That mentioned in 'Worcester in the Olden Times'
(p. 110), must have been of the latter kind. A lithograph of each
is in No. 1 of the Magazine of the Wilts Arch&aelig;ological Society. The
bridle for scolds still exists in several places; there is one in the
Ashmol&oelig;an Museum at Oxford; another was in the magistrates'
room at Shrewsbury, but has been stolen within the last few years;
one is figured in one of the volumes of the Penny Magazine, under
the title 'Obsolete Punishments,' and another in Plott's 'Stafford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>shire;'
but it is very remarkable that though so commonly seen, these
bridles, called 'Branks,' are nowhere mentioned in our law books,
though cucking-stools always are whenever the offence of scolding
is treated of or referred to."</p></div>

<p>But to return to ecclesiastical matters. In the year 1620,
Robert Lucy, of Droitwich, was ordered to appear before the
Sessions Court "for killinge of fleshe this Lent." By the
statutes 2nd and 3rd Edward VI, chap. 19, and 5th Elizabeth,
chap. 5 (an act for maintenance of the navy), the eating of
flesh in Lent is prohibited under penalties; but I know of no
statute which inflicts any penalty on butchers for killing in
Lent.</p>

<p>The Sessions rolls contain some sad pictures of clerical
misbehaviour in the seventeenth century&mdash;a period when the
clergy, as a body, had become a plebeian class, when (as
Macaulay assures us) "for one who made the figure of a
gentleman, ten were mere menial servants," many of the
ejected ministers during the domination of the Puritans
obtaining bread and shelter only by attaching themselves to
the households of royalist gentlemen. The truth of the
observation (see Blount's "Reformation"), that "an indigent
church makes a corrupt and canting clergy," is apparent from
the history of those times. In 1628, articles were exhibited
against the Rev. Henry Hunt, of Defford, "that he is a
malicious and contentious person and useth scandalous
speeches without regard to time or place, but even in the
church, sometimes before and sometimes after divine service,
hath been known to break out into violent swearing
before he came forth of the pulpit, taunting and reviling
Rd. Damanne, and throwing stones at him in the field to
provoke him to strike him, and threatening to make him so
poor with suits that he should be glad to sell his mortuary
for 2d.;" also that he swore falsely at Worcester Assizes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
"His mortuary" here evidently means the amount of property
that he would die worth. In some parishes a sum of
10s. is still payable to the rectors or vicars on the death of
each householder in the parish who dies worth &pound;40. This
is called "a mortuary." The Rev. William Hollington, of
Alvechurch, was in 1641 reported as "a frequenter of alehouses,
where he spendeth much time both day and night,
as well upon the Saboth as other week dayes in idle and
riotous company, in excessive drinking, and is a causer of
much drunkenness by procuring and persuading and enforcing
others to the drinking of whole cupes. He hath often drawn
idle company to his own house, where they have sent for
much ale, and there abusefully have spent in drunkness,
quarrelling, and fighting. He is greatly defamed of incontinensie
with his neighbours' wives, and one of them hath
confest he did attempt her chastity, affirminge him to be as
bad as Bankes his predecessor, who to prevent punishment
for his unchast and incestuous living run away. That he
dayley frequenteth houses much suspected of lewdnes, often
accompanied with a dangerous armed Papist of idle behaviour,
and assisted by him hath in the open street given out rayling
and threatning words against his neighbours, calling them
knaves and partisans, and hath affirmed they were not Papists
that rebelled in Ireland, and that Papists were noe rebbles
but honester men than Protestants. He hath been a hindrance
of the taking of the protestation, and doth omit the words
in the reading of the remonstrance 'and have cutt all theire
throates,' to the end to obscure from the people the greatness
of the danger the House of Commons was in as it is conceived
in favour of the other side. A constable coming to him in
execution of his office to deliver the protestations of such as
were then and there present to take it, he gave him many
reproachful wordes, calling him knave, blockhead, loggerhead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
He is a curser and swearer, a nefarious pintious lyer, and a
contentious person. He stirred up and mayntained many
shutes (suits) and much trouble in the neighbourhood, hath
sided and counselled with the old churchwarden to the detayning
of goods and money due to the church, and threatned
aney that durst question it. He hath laboured to hinder
justice and to countenance delinquents, is a quarreller and
fighter. He advised and aided in stealing away a widdowes
daughter, the only child of his neer neighbour, not
above fourteen years old, and marying her to John Price, a
rude boy of idle behaviour, and noe good cloths to his back,
though the friends of the girl could have made her portion
&pound;200, and hath never been heard to put up one prayer either
for the Parliament or for distressed Protestants in the kingdom
of Irelande except on particular times, and then it was
with the limitation 'if soe that they be of the same religion
as wee are on.'"</p>

<p>It is difficult adequately to estimate the injurious effects to
society of such examples set on the part of the clergy. The
judicious Hooker observes that "the examples of clergy and
great men are important, as being seen afar off, like cities set
on the tops of hills; but mean men's actions are not greatly
inquired into except by those who live at the next door."</p>

<p>During the Commonwealth and the reign of Charles II, as
may be expected, the religious disputes and ill-feeling existing
between the Established Church and the various sects that
snarled and whined and canted in the racy language of the
time, are fully exhibited in these records, of which I shall give
some instances. In 1654, Edward Sheldon and Nicholas Hill
deposed "that upon the 20th day of August the deponents
were objecting against one Mr. Spilsbury, who desired to be
minister of Bromsgrove, that he had a low voyce; one
Humphrey Potter then answered that if he had a low voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
he had a <i>true</i> voice; unto which Mr. Joseph Amige, now
minister of Bromsgrove (as these deponents conceiveth)
answered and sayd, 'Soe have I;' unto whom the said Potter
replied, 'Noe, for you have tould lies in the pulpit,' or words
to that effect." Here is another curious specimen of the
times: In 1656 the jury presented that Thomas Goslinge,
late of Bredon, yeoman, on the 11th November, 1656, at
Bredon, of purpose to defame, disgrace, and provoke one
Richard Beeston, a pious and godly minister and preacher
of the word of God, and to disturb the peace, certain false,
seditious, scandalous, and provoking English words did put
into meeter or verse, and the same as a libell did openly,
maliciously, and of purpose to provoke and disgrace the said
Richard Beeston, in the presence and hearing of divers
honeste people of the commonwealth of Englande, with a loud
voice did saye and singe&mdash;that is to saye:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here comes Mr. Beeston,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The man wee nere wiston,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As high as the pulpitt topp;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to his disgrace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his impudent face,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To reape another man's cropp."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Roger of Wendover tells of a party, who profanely interrupted
divine service, being made to dance in the churchyard
for twelve months, without the power of stopping their limbs.
But it seems that the fear of supernatural punishment did
not deter the brawlers of the seventeenth century. When
Dr. Thomas (afterwards Bishop of Worcester) was vicar of
Loughern, about the year 1644, a party of Parliament horse
went to that place, and inquired whether that popish priest,
Mr. Thomas, was still there, and whether he continued reading
the liturgy and praying for the Queen; one of them adding,
that he would go to church next Sunday, and if Mr. Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
persevered in praying for that drab of the w&mdash;&mdash; of Babylon
he would certainly pistol him. That good man, however, was
not to be intimidated: he performed the usual service, and
while praying for the Queen, one of the soldiers, who sat in
the next pew to him, snatched the book out of his hand and
threw it at his head. The preacher bore it with composure,
but the soldier, it is said, was instantly seized with such compunction
that his comrades were forced to carry him away.
At the Midsummer Sessions of 1660 a deposition was made,
that "on the 17th of June, being ye last Saboth daye,
Jeremiah Hewes, servant of Mr. Bishops of Lindridge, spoke
of Mr. Giles base lascivious words, for he said yt he preached
in ye church nothing but lyes, and furthermore he called him
ould munkke (monk) and he said ye ould monkke preached
in ye forenoon, and his sunn, ye yonge munkker, did endeavour
to mend it in ye afternoone; and he said he would never
heere him preach again, for if he were in ye church he would
goe forthe. Mr. Gyles gave a tuch concerning maypoles&mdash;what
rudnes is ust (used) to be abought such games, and he
wisht he had his beard to make him a flaye (?) yt he might
be one of ye fore leaders; and furthermore, my brother
Edward tould him yt these words did deserve ye good behaviour
(recognizance to keep the peace); and he said again
he did not care for never a justice's warrant in ye countie,
for he saith they are all turncootes." In 1665, Edward
Mutchett, of Norton-juxta-Bredon, informed against Richard
Hunt, that he heard him say in his prayers "Downe with this
King of Babylon, this Poperye, and this idolatrous wayes as
is now sett upp, and that they may not touch Thy anointed."</p>

<p>The Quakers of the seventeenth century, it is pretty well
known, were not the mild and gentle beings who compose the
ranks of the Friends in the nineteenth. They could rail and
brawl in public, would persist in following their trades on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
Sunday, and their resistance to the "powers that be" was of
a much more active character than that which induces a
modern Friend to allow a rate-collector to seize on his tables
and chairs. The Quakers met with severer treatment during
the Commonwealth than any other sect of Christians. We
trace them obscurely under the denomination of "Seekers,"
their distinguishing principle being the doctrine of an inward
light. George Fox, their founder, having bade some of the
justices who committed him to jail to <i>tremble</i> at the word of
the Lord, gave rise to the term "Quakers." In this city and
county they were apparently pursued with great severity after
the restoration of "Church and King," which undoubtedly
had the usual effect of considerably sharpening their asperity
towards the established faith. In the city, they were prevented
entering their meeting-house (in Friar Street), and
accordingly preached in the open air, while soldiers were
paid for watching them. George Fox himself was confined
in Worcester jail. In an ancient library at Kingsnorton
School, there are treatises against the then recently propounded
notions of the Quakers. The subjoined extract
will show that maypoles and long hair were not the only
troubles the poor vicar of that parish had to contend against.
It is taken from "Besse's Sufferings of the Quakers," vol. ii,
chap. iii, p. 60, under date 1657. "Jane Hicks, of Chadwitch,
was sent to prison at Worcester for some offence which the
priest of King's Norton took at her speaking to him." The
same writer also states that at another time she was sent to
Worcester for disturbing at Bromsgrove church, and that
she was placed four times in the stocks&mdash;once for a whole
night and part of two days. The woman would thus seem to
have been a notorious disturber; and doubtless her "speaking"
to the "priest" was in the church at the time of worship&mdash;a
very common custom with the Friends of that day. Viewed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
in this light the vicar's conduct was proper, and was a necessary
precaution against unseemly interruptions. The books of
the above-named library, thus viewed, become interesting to
us. They are evidence in the great Quaker battle, and no
doubt poor Jane Hicks was stirred up with wrath by hearing
some of the arguments out of this storehouse hurled at her
then noisy sect. When John Bissell, also in 1657, refused to
pay the "priest" ten shillings tithe, and had "goods taken
from him worth &pound;1. 5s.," no doubt these identical volumes
were at hand ready to pour forth their artillery against the
poor Quaker.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> In the County Rolls for 1662 is "A calendar
of the prisoners called Quakers: Rd. Payton, convicted <i>de
premunire</i>; Edwd. Hall, convicted for words spoken in open
court, fined &pound;5, and committed till payed; Henry Gibbs,
Wm. Collins, Wm. Webb, Robert Baylis, Rd. Walker <i>alias</i>
Weaver, Jos. Walker, Rd. Bennet, Wm. Eades, Stephen
Pitway, committed the 2nd of January, 1662, for having
lately assembled themselves under the pretence of joyning
in a religious worship, to the great endangering of the publique
peace and safetye, and to the terrour of the people in
severall places of this county." In 1666 the following Quakers
were "taken at a conventicle and committed by Thomas Wilde,
Esq.:" Wm. Pitt, Richard Fydo, Abra. Roberts, Rich. Lewis,
Edward Lewis, Edward Staunton, John Wright, Alexander
Berdslye, Tho. Fitrale, and John Hoskins. Next year (1667)
the gaoler's list of prisoners then in gaol included the following:</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> This notice of Kingsnorton Library is taken from an article in "Aris's

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Thomas Payton, late of Dudley, taylor, a p'fessed Quaker, taken
at a conventicle of Quakers in the said towne of Dudley, a place
much infested with Quakers and disorderlie p'sons, and comitted to
ye gaole 10th July, xiiii Caroli, and being a stubborn and incorigible
p'son, was at ye next Sessions following tendred the oathe of alle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>giance,
which he refused to take, was indicted, and convicted of
premunire. Thomas Feckenham, another leader of the same sect,
was likewise apprehended about three years since, and tendred ye
oathe of allegiance, and beinge still obstinate and p'verse, hath been
continued a prisoner, but with some liberty now and then extended
towards him, which kindness hath not as yet wrought any conformitie
or submission in him. John Jenkins and William Bardoe, Quakers,
excommunicated in ye consistory of Hereford, and taken by a writ
De Excom. Capiend. about a year since. John Roberts, of Droitwich,
p'fessed Quaker, for using his trade and calling on ye Sunday
or Lord's Day, was likewise presented and excommunicated a year
ago. John Tombs, of Droitwich, for the like offence, and for refusing
to permit the sacred ordinance of Baptism to be administered to his
children, likewise excommunicated, and taken up by the like writ.
Job Allibone and William Hodges, for the same offence and refusing
to come to church. All which persons soe committed are, by the
overmuch indulgence of the late sheriff, under-sheriff, and gaoler,
permitted to goe at liberty about their occasions, which we consider
doth encourage them to persist in their contemptuous and incorrigible
behaviour; and they are not to be found in prison unless for about
an houre or a night once in six or eight weeks time."</p></div>

<p>This report of the state of Quakerism, it seems, was
occasioned by a request from the Government that the
magistrates should inquire into the subject, and furnish the
names of the Quakers then in prison, and whether they were
ringleaders or had been seduced into the commission of
offence by others. In the chapter on the records of St.
Helen's church, Worcester, in the earlier part of this work,
it will be observed that the penalties paid by Quakers were
converted into a charitable fund for the poor.</p>

<p>The William Pardoe, mentioned above, was probably the
individual who was said to have been the pastor of a Baptist
congregation at Worcester, where he continued in jail nearly
seven years, and died in this city in 1692. A MS. account
of his labours, travellings, and writings, was said to have
been at Leominster not many years ago. Is it still in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
existence? Mr. Pardoe was excommunicated, and was buried
in a garden at Lowesmoor, near Worcester, where his body,
with that of his wife, was discovered some forty or fifty
years ago while digging for the purpose of building. The
bodies were not disturbed, and a stone was erected to their
memory. I am not aware that this still remains.</p>

<p>We now arrive at something more stirring, and may have
an interesting peep at a conventicle of "Fifth Monarchy Men"
at Oldbury. This sect of religionists had for their distinguishing
tenet a belief in the establishment of a fifth universal
monarchy, of which Christ was to be the head; while the
"saints," under his personal sovereignty, should possess the
earth. They appeared in England towards the close of the
Protectorate; and in 1660, a few months after the Restoration,
they broke out into a serious tumult in London under their
leader Venner; many of them lost their lives, some killed
by the military, and others executed. In the country the sect
continued for some years later. At the concluding Worcestershire
Sessions of 1667, one William Cardale deposed that
on the 1st of September in that year he took his wife to
Oldbury to see her sister, Edward Nightingale's wife, who
was lying-in; and after dinner, he being inclined to fall
asleep, his brother-in-law asked him to go for a walk; they
accordingly went to Oldbury chapel, which they found full
of people. After a psalm had been led, the preacher, who
was a stranger to him, "made a very strange prayer, praying
neither for king, queen, royal familie, nor clergie," and a still
stranger sermon followed, from the text "Thy kingdom
come," "his doctrine beinge, that Christ hath a kingdome
of rewarde for his sufferinge and workinge servants, which in
his good time he would possess them, and we ought to pray
for;" and he attempted to prove, from the Revelations,
Daniel, and other mystical writings, that the aforesaid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
kingdom was to be on earth. "On the preacher proposing
to show <i>when</i> this kingdom was to come, an alarm of soldiers
was given, a horse was soon got ready for him, and throwing
off his gown and perriwig, he appeared in a grey coat, and
speedily worked his way through the crowd and made off." A
soldier, named William Perrott, deposed that by command
of his officer, Major Wilde, he with others was sent to apprehend
this preacher, whose name was Steele, <i>alias</i> Fraser, a
Nonconformist; and on arriving at Oldbury chapel they found
about 2000 persons there. When the preacher had disappeared,
Perrott with two others secured the doors of the
chapel; shortly after which some of the congregation "looked
out of the windows to see whether any more soldiers appeared,
and observing none, they presently swore that three or four
were not able to keepe so manye prisoners. Forthwith thereupon
they broke open the doors upon us, and layd hold upon
my haire, my pistolls, and cloake, and gave me severall blowes
upon my head and bodye, and likewise of those soldiers
that were present with me. They alsoe forced one of my
pistolls out of my hande, and alsoe broake Mr. Hambden's
man's pistoll about our heads. After the rest of our partye
of horse appeared, most of them runn from us. Some few
were took. Alsoe I observed a great many of benches as I
supposed newly set upp about ye chapel to receive ye company."
What became of the unfortunate prophesier of the
coming kingdom doth not appear.</p>

<p>In the year 1669, Thomas Willmot, vicar of Bromsgrove,
laid an information at the Sessions to the effect that, "being
ready to attend his duty at the funeral of Jane, the wife of
John Eckols, was by a tumult of Anabaptists affronted and
disturbed whilst I was reading the service. They no sooner
came to the grave but irreverently threw the corps thereinto,
and having their hats on their heads, immediately, contrary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
to the orders of the Church, without the least respect to the
service of the same, and without either clerk or sexton, with
their feete caste in the mold and covered the corps. Amongst
which tumult there was one Henry Waldron, who entring
into the belman's house without his leave, took away his spade,
wherewith John Price, contrary to all civility and decency,
notwithstanding he was checked by the minister, with his
head covered, persisted to throwe the mold in the aforesaid
grave."</p>

<p>The last instance of open disaffection to the church service
which is worth a place in this record occurs in 1692, when
an information was laid against Michael Bisset, of Feckenham.
It appeared that Richard Bond and one Foster having publicly
praised a sermon delivered in Feckenham church by a parson
named Millard, Bissett swore by God's wounds (a common
oath in those days) "That there was never a true word in
the same sermon, and that it was all nought and false, and
that it would have been a good deede to have sett him
downe out of the pulpit with a bowe and bolte (meaning the
said preacher), and that he could go down in the meadows
and hear as good a sermon under a hedge." Bolt is a short
arrow shot from a cross-bow. Hence the saying, "A fool's
bolt is soon shot." There are several specimens of these
bows and bolts at Goodrich Castle.</p>

<p>The Toleration Act of William III gave immunity to all
Protestant Dissenters, except those who denied the Trinity,
from the penal laws to which they had been subjected. In
the Sessions' order book, date 1696, is a "Mem. That the
persons under-named in open Court of Sessions did take the
oaths mentioned and appointed to be taken in and by an
Act made <i>Anno primo Willi et Marie</i>, entitled 'An Act for
abrogating of the oaths of allegiance and supremacy, and
appointing other oaths;' and also made and subscribed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
declaration appointed to be made and subscribed in and
by an Act made <i>Anno 25 Caroli Secundi</i>, entitled 'An Act
for preventing dangers which may happen from Popish
recusants,' according to an Act made <i>Annis 7 et Willi tertii
Regis</i>, entitled 'An Act requiring the practicers of the law
to take the oaths and subscribe the declarations therein
mentioned.'" The following are the names of the subscribers

<p>An explanation is necessary with regard to "signing the
association," as stated above. In Harris's Life of William III,
p. 143, under the date of 1688, it is stated that after the
arrival of the gentlemen of Somerset and Dorsetshire, at
Exeter, "Sir Edward Seymour asked Dr. Burnet 'Why they
had not got an <i>association</i>, without which they were only a
rope of sand, and none would think themselves bound to
stick to them.' The Doctor told him 'It was for want of a
man of his authority and credit to support such an advice.'"
He then proposed it to the Prince, who, with the Earl of
Shrewsbury and all present, approved the motion. Accordingly
the Doctor did urge an association, containing "a solemn
engagement firmly to adhere together in pursuance of the
ends of the Prince's declaration, and in defence thereof, and
never to depart from it till the religion, laws, and liberties of
the people should be secured by a free Parliament; and if any
attempt should be made on the person of the Prince, that it
should be revenged on all by whom any such attempt should
be made." This association was speedily signed there and in
other places, particularly by many in the University of Oxford.
Lord Herbert of Cherbury, and the principal gentlemen of
Worcestershire and Herefordshire, met at Worcester, and
declared for the Prince of Orange, when Sir Walter Blount
and the Sheriff of Worcestershire were sent prisoners to
Ludlow Castle. The declaration, I presume, continued to be
signed for several subsequent years.</p>

<p>The only remaining noticeable item affecting Nonconformity
is an order made in or about the year 1716, "that an
indenture of apprenticeship made between John Cookes and
his master, Samuel Gill, be discharged and set aside, it
appearing to this court that the master gave his said apprentice
imoderate correccon and alsoe employing him in
another trade, viz., plateing of gunn barrells and <i>obligeing
him to goe to the Presbyterian</i> meeting." It may be stated,
in concluding this chapter, that the law enforcing attendance
at the parish church on Sunday was not abolished till 1846.
Other notes on Nonconformity will be found in this volume.</p>

<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> year 1643, so distressing to the city of Worcester,
when a great portion of the heavy levies on the
citizens, for defence against the Parliament army,
could not be raised, was nearly to the same extent a cause
of pecuniary embarrassment to the county at large. At the
April Sessions of 1643 the grand jury ordered "that the &pound;3000
ordered last Sessions to be paid monthly towards the payment
of his majesty's forces sent and raised for the defence
of this county be continued till next Sessions, and paid over
by John Baker, gen. collector to Sir William Russell, High
Sheriff of the county and Governor of the city." But con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>siderable
difficulty appears to have been experienced in the
collection. Here follows a picture of those critical times,
worth preserving:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The information of Edward Raynolls, of Kitherminster, taken
uppon oath the 28th of March, 1651, before Gervase Bucke and
John Latham, Esqs., two of the Justices of the Peace for the county
aforesaid.</p>

<p>"Hee saith and doth informe that Edward Broad of Duncklin,
Esq., about the time of the beginning of the warre betwixt the late
kinge and the Parliament did raise a troope of horse for his sonne
Edmond to engage in the king's service. That afterwards about the
time when Sir Gilbert Garret, the gov'nor of Worcester for the kinge
went to beseige Sturton Castle&mdash;a garrison for the Parliament&mdash;the
said Edward Broade sollicited and earnestly pressed the contry
thereaboute to rise together and to goe along with the said Sir
Gilbert Garrett, telling and threatening divers of the country people
that they should be hanged at their owne doores if they would not
goe with him against the said Castle: That many of the country
people came in to the said Edward Broade accordingly and hee was
himselfe captaine over them and furnished them with arms and
amunition and marched before them to Sturton Castle and continued
before that Castle untill the governor whoe held the same for the
Parliament was inforced, beinge overpowred by the enemye to yeeld
yt upp. That afterwards, about 7 dayes before Sir Henry Lyngum
did rise against the Parliament and surprised and tooke the county
troope of Hereford, the said Edward Broade spake to this informer,
beinge his tenant and his warriner, to goe to John Brancill, dwelling
at Kidderminster, beinge a joyner and well skilled in stockinge of
guns, to come with all speede to stock gunnes for him. And willing
this informer alsoe himselfe to be in redinesse. And this informer
askinge him what use there would be for soe many gunnes the said
Edward Broade answered there would be use for them verry speedily,
and further said that Mr. Hugh Vicaridge of Comberton and Mr.
Thomas Wannerton, other Roundheaded Rogues, should be hanged
to beginn withall. And the said Brancill came to Duncklyn
accordingly, but how many gunnes he stocked this informer knoweth
not. And afterwards when the newes was fresh that Sir Henry
Lingin had surprised the Hereford county troope, the said Edward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
Broade asked this informer whether Sir Henry Lyngin was gone,
whereunto this informer answering that hee did not know, the said
Edward Broade replyed and said Sir Henry Lingin was not as
good as his word; and about a weeke after Sir Henry Lingin was
surprised the said Edward Broade hid divers gunnes which hee had
provided as aforesaid under a rick of hay and afterwards remooved
them thence and hid them under a corne mowe in one of the barnes
att Duncklin where they weare seene within a yeare and a halfe
last past by one Thomas Lovell, a workman belonging to that
house, as he tould this informer.</p>

<p>"And this informer doth further informe upon his oath that
about a year last past beinge att Bridgnorth in company with
Edward Powys, of the citty of Worcester, bookbinder, and others
drinking together, hee this informer heard the said Powys begin A
health to the good proceeding of the king's army in Scotland,
likewise A health to the queene his mother, and the third health
to the confusion of the Parliament, and that hee began all these 3
healths together, but none of the company would pledge the same,
some of them answering that they would drinke to ye conversion
but not to the confusion of any. And that Steephen Dowty of the
Morphe and his servant William Lawde were then in company, and
further doth not informe."</p></div>

<p>"Articles" were "exhibited" (that is, an information was
laid) in the year 1655, against Walter Moyle, of Ombersley,
yeoman, for being a profane man, and for that "one day he
publicly drank the health of the devil, and fell down as one
dead, to ye amazement and terrour of ye beholders; and that
in the time of the late war he did threaten his neighbours,
when the king's forces were in rendevouze at Oddingley
Heath, with plunder unlesse they would repaire in armes to
that randezvooze."</p>

<p>On the 5th of October, 1685, John Bartlam, of Whitbourne,
laid an information that "in hay harvest last (before this
neighbourhood heard that Monmouth was routed), this informant,
riding upon the road near Knightsford bridge, there met
a man that tould him that Monmouth was then the head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
man in England, and that it was in every man's mouth in
Worcester, and that any man might speak it, and that he
would proclaim it at Knightsford bridge (as he had at Broadheath,
Martley, and other places, as he came along), although
it was so near Captain Clent's; and that if any one questioned
it he would be at Knightsford bridge to answer it; that his
name was Kent, and he lived in Powick's Lane, Worcester."
In 1687, Thomas Knight, of Castlemorton, was summoned to
appear at the Sessions, and to give evidence against Charles
Jakeman for drinking the Duke of Monmouth's health.</p>

<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> following document, included among the rolls, is

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Dame Mary Yate, having asked his majesty's permission to
pass beyond the seas, for the recovery of her health, his majesty
was most graciously pleased to grant her request, under the usual
clauses and provisoes, according to which ye said Dame Mary
Yate having given security not to enter into any plott or conspiracy
against his majesty or his realms, or behave herself in any such
manner as may be prejudicial to his majesty's government, or
the religion here by law established, and that she will not repaire
to the city of Roome, or return unto this kingdome without first
acquainting one of his majesty's principal secretaries of state, and
obtaining leave for the same, in pursuance of his majesty's commands
in council hereby will and require you to permit and suffer the
said Dame Mary Yate to imbarque with her trunkes of apparel
and other necessaries not prohibited at any port of this kingdom,
and from thence to pass beyond the seas, provided that shee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>

14.</p></div>

<p>If the above refers to the celebrated Lady Mary Yate
(a daughter of the house of Pakington) who is commemorated
on a monument in Chaddesley Church as having died in 1696,
at the age of 86, she must have been 70 years old when these
precautions were taken by the Government against the poor
old lady attempting to invade the country or to comfort the
Pope with her presence and support. Dame Mary Yate
was no doubt a Roman Catholic, and the permission above
referred to was granted under the 7th section of the statute
3rd James I, chap. 5, which was virtually repealed by the
statute 43rd George III, chap. 30, which exempted Roman
Catholics from all the penalties and restrictions mentioned
and enjoined in the older acts, if in one of the Courts at
Westminster or at the Quarter Sessions they made a declaration
which to them was unobjectionable.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">Upton</span> bridge seems to have been a nuisance to the
county ever since the time of the Civil Wars, when
one of its arches was destroyed for purposes of
defence. Frequent complaint was made of its dilapidations,
and in 1757 the Sessions ordered that a frigate should be
bought "for carrying workmen, stone, and other purposes,
about the said repairs." Mr. Sheward was appointed superintendent
of the said bridge in 1775, at the salary of one
guinea a year.</p>

<p>A presentment was made in 1661, that "the causeways and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
horse bridges leading from the city of Worcester to London,
and towards the city of Gloucester, which ought, as wee
humbly conceave, to be mayntayned and repaired by the
Dean and Chapter, are very defective and out of repaire."
About five years later the capitular body were again presented
"for not repairing a certain causeway leading from a certain
messuage called or known by the name of ye Three Crowns,
St. Peter's, to a place called Red Hill Cross, in the said
parish, and soe from thence to a place called Whitton Pound,
thence to a place called Staple Cross in the parish of Norton,
being the London road, and likewise one other causeway
leading from the newly-erected inn called ye White House,
through the parish of St. Peter's, at a place called Clarken
Lipp, in the parish of Kempsey, being the road leading to
Bristol." And for the third time, in 1689, the Dean and
Chapter were presented "for not repairing their causeways
from outside Sidbury gate to the further end of Clarkenlip,
upon ye Gloster road." In the Townsend Manuscript (elsewhere
alluded to) it is recorded that "by virtue of a commission
dated March, 1652, out of Chancery for charitable uses,
the Commissioners sat on the 12th January, 1653, and by the
oaths of 12 men on the inquiry, did order and decree that the
several manors and lands of the Dean and Chapter of the
Cathedral Church of Worcester were charged by way of
repriz. for the payment of &pound;40 yearly towards the repayres
of the several highways therein expressed, and should so
continue for ever. The like for &pound;106. 13s. 4d. for 40 poor
schollers of the grammar school at the Colledg unto every of

Dean and Chapter to be imployed for the use of the causeys,
one from Worcester to Redhill Cross, and the other towards
Kempsey, and he to pay the same to the surveyors." The
Dean and Chapter were liable to repair these roads <i>ratione
tenur&aelig;</i>, that is by reason of their being the owners of certain
lands. These roads are now repaired by the turnpike tolls;
but if the tolls became inadequate, and the Dean and Chapter
were before liable to the repair, they would still continue to
to be so now.</p>

<h3>Compositions to the King's
Household.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/il-p133o.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">On</span> the 20th of November, 1613, a certificate was
sent down from Whitehall to "our very loving
friends, the Justices of the Peace and compounders
for the county of Worcester," which, after the usual "heartey
commendations," &amp;c., set forth that "Thomas Gunner, his
Majesty's servant, under-tacker for the countie of Worcester,
hath delivered for the service of his Majestie and his most
hon. house, for the compost of the 11th yere of his Highnes
raigne, 20 fatt oxen, 20 fatt muttons, 20 stirks, and 40 lambs,
all good and serviceable, and soe wee bid you heartily farewell."
There were two certificates in the year 1640&mdash;the one
"that Thomas Hill, your undertaker for the composition of
lambes, hath, on behalfe of the country, delivered into the
office of his Majesty's Poultry at the Court, the full number
of 150 lambes," due for the year ending the last day of September;
and the other, for 20 fat oxen, 200 fat muttons, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
20 stirks, due for the year ending the last day of December.
Nash states that the purveyance for this county in 1660 was&mdash;20
oxen, or a composition of &pound;4 a head, to be paid June 16th;
200 muttons, or 6s. 8d. a head, paid July 10th; 150 lambs,
or 1s. a head, August 15th; and 20 stirks, or 10s. a head,
October 8th.</p>

<p>These compositions arose out of the prerogative of purveyance.
Mr. John Bruce, F.S.A., in his "Verney Papers,"
published by the Camden Society (p. 86), says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The prerogative of purveyance was one of those ancient rights
of sovereignty which in practice were most annoying to the people.
It consisted of the power of taking, at certain fixed low prices and
with or without the consent of the owner, for the use of the royal
household, any provisions which an officer called a purveyor thought
proper to select. With that wisdom which distinguished the
government of Queen Elizabeth, we find that this ancient right was
not harshly enforced, but made the subject of a clear arrangement,
which avoided in practice all the heartburnings and contentions
which are sure to follow from carrying out an indefinite authority."</p></div>

<p>The powers of purveyance having been suspended during
the time of the Commonwealth, Charles II at his Restoration
consented to resign entirely these branches of his revenue
and power, and they were abolished by the statute 12th
Charles II, chap. 24, Parliament granting him in lieu an
excise duty on beer and ale of 15d. a barrel and a proportionate
sum for other liquors. But temporary acts were
subsequently passed suspending this statute in favour of the
King's royal progresses, and in favour of the navy and
ordnance.</p>

<h3>THE DINELEY MANUSCRIPTS.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/il-p135a.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">Among</span> the valuable manuscripts in existence relating
to this county are the Dineley, Jeffries, and Townsend,
besides those of Dr. Prattenton, now in possession
of the Society of Antiquaries. To preserve these,
with a view to publication, should be an object of solicitude
to all literary men of the county. The Dineley Manuscripts
(now in the possession of Sir T. E. Winnington, Bart., M.P.)
consist of three volumes, written between 1670 and 1680 by
Thomas Dineley, Esq., a member of one of the oldest Worcestershire
families. One of the volumes contains accounts
of his visits to many churches in this county as also to
adjacent towns and about a dozen cathedrals; pen and ink
sketches of monuments, coats of arms, dresses, &amp;c., many
of them exquisitely done; copies of inscriptions, both quaint
and curious; tracings of pedigrees, &amp;c.; showing the compiler
to have been a gentleman well versed in ecclesiastical antiquities,
a classical scholar, acquainted with heraldry, and
an accurate draughtsman. The second volume is entitled
"Observations in a Voyage in the Kingdom of France,
being a collection of several monuments, inscriptions, draughts
of towns, &amp;c."&mdash;date 1675; and the latter part of this
volume is devoted to a similar description of Ireland,
with a curious dissertation on the manners and customs of
the Irish. The filthy habits of that people in the seventeenth
century are treated of in rather broad language, not adapted
for the present day. The third volume has the following
title: "The Jovrnall of my Traveils through the Low<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>-Countreys,
Anno D'ni 1674." It appears that in December,
1671, Mr. Dineley went in the suite of "Sir G. Downing,
Knt. and Bart., Ambassador from his most sacred Ma'tie to
ye States Generall of the United Provinces." His journal
is written in a minute but beautiful caligraphy, and denotes
habits of judicious observation. In his notice of the town of
Dort, in Holland, he alludes to the great abundance of salmon,
and mentions a custom which I had long thought was by
no means confined to our own city of Worcester: he observes,
"It is sayd that prentices and maid servants, before they
enter into service, indent not to be oblig'd to eat salmon
above twice a week;" and in his account of the Irish
(chapter on Limerick) Mr. Dineley alludes to a "salmon
weire, out of town, having a castle without timber or nayle,
in the middle of the river," where the custom was "to
grant tickets for salmon gratis to all strangers who will eat
them upon the place; this the corpora'con is obliged to,
though they set it for &pound;200 per ann." In some commonplace
notes at the end of the volume is the following entry:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Hops among other things brought into England 15 Hen. 8.
wherefore this rithme&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Turkeyes, carps, hops, pickerel, and beer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came into England all in one year."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>There is another of Mr. Dineley's volumes in the collection
of the Duke of Beaufort, at Badminton; it describes a tour
through Wales with the President of the Marches, an ancestor
of the Duke's. It is mentioned in Blakeway's History
of Shrewsbury.</p>


<h3>THE JEFFRIES MANUSCRIPTS.</h3>

<p>Henry Jeffries (who died in 1709), the last heir male and
proprietor of the manor of Clifton-on-Teme, was a man of
some learning, and left a manuscript memorandum book in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
which he had jotted down his own observations <i>de omnibus
rebus</i>, and generally in so easy and familiar a way as to render
them agreeable as well as instructive. This relic likewise
belongs to Sir Thomas Winnington, one of whose ancestors
married the heiress of the Jeffries family about a century and
a half ago. Specimens of its multifarious contents are given
in vol. ii of "The Rambler in Worcestershire," from which
they appear to be invested with great local interest to the
neighbourhood of Clifton, Stanford, and Shelsey, as also to
the general antiquary.</p>


<h3>DIARY OF MISTRESS JOYCE JEFFRIES.</h3>

<p>There is also a Manuscript Diary of Miss Joyce Jeffries in
the possession of Sir T. Winnington. The diary contains an
account of the state of domestic life among the upper classes,
during the reign of Charles I, in the counties of Worcester
and Hereford, and relates to Ham Castle, in the parish of
Clifton-on-Teme, where this lady resided, and the siege of
the city of Hereford, where she also possessed a residence,
during the calamities of civil war. It is hoped that the
Manuscript will be published, and no one can be found more
able for the task of editor than the Rev. J. Webb, of Tretire,
near Ross, who has already published a most valuable work,
of local as well as general interest, on the Household Roll of
Bishop Swinfield of Hereford, of which I have given an
abstract further on.</p>

<p>Mistress Joyce Jeffries was the half-sister of Humphrey
Coningsby, Esq., of Neen Sollers, a gentleman remarkable
for his chivalrous enterprise as a traveller in the reign of
James I. This autograph account book embraces a period
of nine years, and embodies many curious particulars bearing
upon the events, persons, and manners of the age, also setting
forth the writer as the representative of a class now only to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
seen in family pictures of the time. She lived unmarried,
had an income of more than &pound;500 per annum, in the expenditure
of which she was very generous. Her dress was costly;
she employed false curls and curling irons, wore many rings,
used spectacles, and carried a whistle suspended at her girdle
by a yard of loop black lace&mdash;probably for a little dog. A
Cypress cat was given her by the Lady Dansey of Brinsop,
and she kept a throstle in a twiggen cage. She had many
god-children, to one of whom (Mistress Eliza Acton) she
gave &pound;800 as a marriage portion. Madam Jeffries kept
several servants, and went abroad in a coach drawn by two
mares. She was very observant of the festivals and ceremonies
of the church, and contributed to the wassell of the
hinds when they lighted their twelve fires, and made the
fields resound with their revelry; and on Valentine's Day
gave Tom Aston, Dick Gravell, or any other male, a present
in money for coming to be her Valentine. She sent the
mayor a present of ten shillings on his law-day, and on one
occasion dined with him, when the waits were in attendance,
to whom she gave money; and she was generous to travelling
minstrels and showmen, as "to a boy that did sing like a
blackbird," "to Cherlickcombe and his jackanapes," and
"to a man that had the dancing horse at the Hereford
Midsummer fair." As to what befell her in the troubled
time of the Civil War, the book passes from the year 1638
to the end of 1647, during which England toiled and suffered
under intestine strife. No county was more loyal to the royal
cause than that of Hereford. In 1638, Mrs. Jeffries pays
ship-money and another impost called "the king's provision,"
and finds a soldier for her property in Hereford and elsewhere.
In 1641 she purchases pamphlets and news-books
and takes an interest in passing political events. In September,
1642, when the Earl of Essex entered Worcester, and sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
the Earl of Stamford to occupy Hereford, she quitted her
town house and went to Garnons, the residence of Mr. Geers,
a few miles distant, thinking she would be there in security;
but in the plundering which took place by the Earl of
Stamford's soldiers, immediately upon their arrival, the house
of Mr. Geers was visited and pilfered by Captain Hammond,
who carried off much goods, including her two bay coach
mares. At the same time she had other property secreted
and saved in other places. The Parliamentarians having left
the city in December, it was reoccupied by the Royalists, and
her friend and cousin, Fitzwilliam Coningsby, was made
Governor; when, besides her regular assessment, she sent
him a present of &pound;50 to pay his soldiers, and a bullock worth
&pound;6. In the spring of 1643 he marched with the rest of the
commissioners of the county and the Herefordshire levies to
join the little army of Lord Herbert of Raglan, at Highnam
near Gloucester, where they were all captured by Sir William
Waller. Hereford continued unmolested till the month of
April, and Mistress Jeffries returned for a few days to her
house, but the report of the Parliamentarians coming once
more to assail the city under the command of that general
drove her once more to her retreat. Her house at Widemarsh
Gate suffered during his attack on the city, but she remained
in quiet at Garnons until April, 1644. As the county was
now seriously disturbed by the contending parties she suddenly
took flight again, visiting Hereford for the last time,
and carrying off her trunks and chests and servants to Ham
Castle, the seat of her cousin Jeffries, on the banks of the
Teme, on the edge of the county of Worcester. Soldiers
were still quartered in her house at Hereford, and she pays
for work done in making bulwarks to defend the city. At
length, in 1645, when the whole of the suburbs were laid
bare up to the walls by order of the governor, Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
Barnabas Scudamore, her new house and several others her
property without Widemarsh Gate were pulled down. She
takes this as a matter of course, without comment upon the
hardship of the proceeding, and upon all occasions shows a
cheerful and contented mind. In many other respects she felt
the effects of the war, and symptoms of them frequently
appear in her accounts. She contributed to the lecturers
introduced into the churches; her cousin's child was "baptised
after the new directory;" and the committee men laid their
hands on her property and straitened her means, though she
still persevered in the unwearied exercise of humanity and
in bestowing her charity on others. As she advances in years
her accounts exhibit a trait or two of her approaching infirmities:
she loses various small articles of value&mdash;spectacles and
rings, which her servants find and bring to her, and are
rewarded accordingly; and the recurrence of this excites
some suspicion of their knavery. The death of her cousin
Herbert Jeffries, at Ham Castle, in consequence of his
breaking his leg, disturbed her tranquillity, and is described
with melancholy minuteness. Age seems to have neither
abated her generous feeling nor the ardour of her domestic
affections. She was always interested in those events which
usually bring joy to families and occasional entries in our
parochial registers. The union of Miss Acton, her goddaughter,
with Mr. Francis Geers, and a christening that
took place at Ham Castle a very short time before her death
(the child receiving her own Christian name), was to her a
source of infinite pleasure. She went on, "giving" to some
and "forgiving" others, to the close of her beneficent career.
She died in April, 1648, and was buried in the chancel of
the parish church of Clifton-on-Teme, where her memory
is still revered by those to whom her existence and character
are known.</p>

<h3>THE TOWNSEND MANUSCRIPTS.</h3>

<p>One of the Townsend Manuscripts is in the possession of
Mr. G. E. Roberts, of Kidderminster. It is an interleaved

It is well bound in calf, with initials of the Knight ("H. T.")
impressed on sides, and autograph on fly-leaf. Sir Henry's
aim may have been to render it a book of legal reference, as
upon one of the first leaves he gives a key to a great part of
the Manuscript in a list of authorities quoted. But amongst
them exists much matter of a more interesting nature. The

<h3>VACARIUS' ROMAN LAW.</h3>

<p>A Manuscript was recently discovered in the Worcester
Chapter library, which is believed to be unique in this
country&mdash;at least there is no record of any similar one
having ever been found here&mdash;it is Vacarius's Epitome of
the Roman law. A description of this valuable manuscript
was recently published in the "Legal Examiner" by Mr.
Hastings, barrister-at-law, of Worcester. Vacarius was
a celebrated Italian doctor of law, a native of Lombardy,
who it is supposed was brought to this country by Theobald,
Archbishop of Canterbury, and became professor of law at
Oxford, in the reign of Stephen. There he introduced the
study of the Roman law, just then reviving throughout
Europe, after the discovery of the Pandects at Amalfi; there
also he wrote his famous work, comprising an epitome of the
whole Roman law, for the use of his very numerous pupils.
At length, either through jealousy or Papal influence, he was
forbidden to lecture, was banished from the University, and
his books ordered to be destroyed. It is supposed that he
himself took holy orders and retired to a monastery. Although
his numerous pupils, on leaving Oxford, had each, no doubt,
for the most part secured a copy for themselves, no record
exists of one having ever been found in England during the
seven centuries which succeeded, so effectual was the royal
mandate for their destruction. The only instance in which
Vacarius is known to be mentioned by any of our legal writers
is by Blackstone, who merely states the fact of the introduction
of the civil law into England by such a personage, and
for a long time Vacarius was thought to be nothing more than
a mythological embodiment of the introduction of Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
law into this country. On the continent the only four copies
of his work known to be in existence are deposited in the
libraries of Konigsberg, Prague, and Bruges, and one in the
possession of the Emperor of Russia. Great search has been
made in our public libraries, and those of the cathedrals especially,
as it was thought that had any copies survived the
order for their destruction, they would have been stored in
the monasteries, and from thence been transferred to our
cathedrals at the Reformation; but the inquiry was entirely
unsuccessful until a few months ago, when a copy was found
in the Worcester Chapter library, concealed under the name
of the "Code of Justinian." Every reasonable proof of its
identity has been given, although the title is missing. It is
otherwise in good preservation, and beautifully written and
illuminated. It need not be added how valuable the manuscript
is as a monument of the first introduction of the Roman
law into England after the Norman Conquest. The manuscript
should be preserved, newly bound, and the missing portions
supplied by copying from one of the other existing manuscripts.
Then some enterprising publisher should give it to
the world in English (as Mr. Bohn has done for the Norman
and Saxon Chronicles).</p>


<h3>ABINGTON'S MANUSCRIPT.</h3>

<p>Mr. Cadby, bookseller, of 83, New Street, Birmingham,
recently advertised for sale "Some Memoirs relating to the
Church and City of Worcester, collected by one of the Ancient
Family of the Abingtons, which came to the hands of Robert
Dobyns, late of Easbath, and now of the City of Hereford,
Esq., who, out of the Love he bears to the said Church and
City where he was Born and Baptised, <i>transmitted this Copy

vellum, neatly written in contracted German characters,
about the period of Elizabeth and James I, 143 pp., 20
Guineas. The original could not be found when the above
was bequeathed, nor has it been heard of since; consequently
this is the only one in existence, and must now take the place
of the original." I have not myself seen this Manuscript,
but a friend informs me that it wears the appearance of genuineness.
After referring to Worcester in connection with
Roman times, its possession by the Wiccian Kings is spoken
of, and then the foundation of the bishopric in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 680. Year
by year it records the events in the history of the bishopric
up to 1486, which is the last date. Some reference is also

occupy most of the book. The chief towns and villages in
the county are also referred to.</p>


<h3>BISHOP SWINFIELD'S ROLL.</h3>

<p>"A roll of the household expenses of Richard de Swinfield,
Bishop of Hereford, during part of the years 1289 and 1290."
This valuable Manuscript was discovered about forty years
ago by Dr. Prattinton, of Bewdley, among the muniments at
Stanford Court, the seat of Sir T. E. Winnington, Bart. Dr.
Prattinton made an abstract of it, which he presented, with
his other Worcestershire papers, to the Society of Antiquaries;
but it was not till the year 1853 that the roll was
edited and published, when the Rev. John Webb, of Tretire,
undertook the task, and by his extensive research in medi&aelig;val
history has succeeded in converting the meagre materials
of the roll&mdash;presenting as it does nearly the earliest picture
of English life in existence&mdash;into a most interesting detail
of the character and events, the manners and customs of the
thirteenth century, so as to attract considerable notice among
antiquaries. The work was printed in two volumes, in 1853<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
and 1854, for the Camden Society; and as some portions of
the Bishop's itinerary through his diocese is connected with
Worcestershire I shall make a few extracts and comments
thereon:&mdash;</p>

<p>Salt was purchased by the Bishop's household (when at
Colwall) from Worcester, and supplied from the pits at Droitwich.
His lordship's cook also made purchases at Worcester,
(having been sent from Colwall for the purpose), and a large
supply of ware in cups, plates, and dishes, was laid in against
the Paschal entertainment at Colwall; so that this city, it
would seem, was famous even six centuries ago for the manufacture
of table ware, though composed of a different material
from that which has rendered its products celebrated in the
present day. Here also the prelate sent for a new bridle
and saddle, on which Mr. Webb remarks&mdash;"Worcester might
then have been, what it certainly in after times has been,
more advanced than Hereford in the arts of life." The
Bishop had some land in this county and a house in the city
of Worcester.</p>

<p>The editor notices the prolific vines that cover the cottages
in the counties of Worcester, Gloucester, and Hereford.
Bishop Swinfield's vineyard at Ledbury yielded seven pipes
of white wine and nearly one of verjuice in the autumn of
1289. Bristol was the great mart for foreign wine, and the
custom was to send a "squire" to make the purchase there
and accompany the cargo up the Severn home, to prevent
the malpractices of boatmen, who it seems were as much
inclined to "suck the monkey" in those days as at present.
The wine was usually landed at Upton and thence conveyed
by land carriage to Bosbury, where was the Bishop's favourite
residence. No mention is made of Herefordshire cider in
that century, nor is the date of its introduction known.</p>

<p>John de Kemesye, the Bishop's steward and treasurer (and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
the writer of this roll), belonged to a good family who took
their name from the village of Kempsey, four miles south of
Worcester. Walter of that name was instituted to the vicarage
of Lindridge in July, 1277, and presented, in November, 1292,
by the convent of Worcester, to the church of St. Martin, in
the same city. Thomas de Kemesye was the abbot of
Tewkesbury who received the benediction from Godfrey
Giffard, Bishop of Worcester, on Trinity Sunday, 1282. The
Bishops of Worcester had a palace at Kempsey, at which
Henry II held his Court, and Simon de Montfort, with his
royal prisoner, Henry III, lodged previously to the battle of
Evesham. The writer of this roll was long remembered
in the church of Kempsey, where he founded a chantry
well endowed for masses at the altar of the blessed Virgin,
for his welfare in life, his own soul, those of his parents
and benefactors, and of all the faithful departed. He left
rents for a taper to burn before her altar, and in his grants
for these purposes took special heed to secure the respectability
of such as should officiate at these services, by regulations
drawn up with the minutest care.</p>

<p>In the year 1275 two questions respecting church property
in the county of Worcester came under the decision of trial
by combat: one on June 25th, in Hardwick Meadow, for the
church of Tenbury, which was adjusted, after all, without
duel, in favour of the Abbot of Lyra; a second, on July 9th,
was for the bailiwick of Hembury (Hanbury?) and here the
Bishop of Worcester's champion vanquished the champion of
Philip de Stok. The Bishop of Hereford likewise kept a
champion in his suite, who received regular wages; and when
Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, laid claim to the chase
on the western slopes of the Malvern range, the Bishop's
representative was prepared to do battle in the lists if need
were; but a jury, composed of men drawn from the counties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
of Worcester and Hereford, decided in favour of the church,
and a trench of separation between the two possessions was
made by the disappointed Earl along the ridge of the hill,
where it remains a memorial of the contest to the present
day.</p>

<p>Foresters were in general an impudent and abandoned
race. Those of Feckenham, where the king had a palace or
hunting seat, incurred his particular displeasure by their
depredations. He dealt summarily with them in the spring
of 1289-90, when he progressed there, by committing some
of them to prison, and some he fined. On April 2nd he
admitted all the latter to bail to appear at Woodstock by
the 5th of that month, in Easter week, and there he fixed
their fines. In the following autumn they insulted the Prior
of Worcester, near Herforton (Harvington?) as he was travelling
along the road, robbed his servants of their bows
and arrows, and sounded their horns on all sides against
him. But the monk of Worcester who narrates this circumstance
does not tell us what may be learned elsewhere, and
was perhaps one cause of the insult, that his own Prior had
been a trespasser in the said forest, and was fined for it.
The Bishop of Worcester also was a trespasser, and paid 500
while the Prior paid 200 marks. (See further account of
this in vol. iii, p. 149, of the "Rambler in Worcestershire.")
In case of trespass by hunting or border hostility the foresters
and others used to shout and blow their horns, to bring in
the country to their aid. Hence the northern border tenure
of cornage.</p>

<p>On occasion of episcopal visitations, the clergy visited were,
except in special cases, bound to provide food, &amp;c., for the
Bishop and his attendants, but sometimes the suite was so
numerous as to lead to great inconvenience. In 1290,
Godfrey, Bishop of Worcester, in spite of canonical prohi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>bition,
being at variance with the Prior and Convent of
Worcester, came to visit them with 140 horses and a multitude
of attendants, and continued with them three days; but
this was not done without an appeal on the part of the Prior.
The Bishop turned the Prior out of the chamber; and it
seems like an aggressive act that need not have been committed,
if then, as since, the Bishop had a palace hard by
the Cathedral. For remedy of such encroachments the
Lateran Council, under Pope Alexander III, had specially
defined the limits of bishops' and archdeacons' trains. Bishop
Godfrey Giffard frequently preached at visitations, and some
of the texts of his discourses addressed to religious houses
are extant in his register; an instance of which is as
follows: "Procurationes Episcopi. Item, die Jovis in crastino
beati Michaelis, dominus Episcopus visitavit apud Sanctum
Augustinum Bristolli&aelig;, et pr&aelig;dicavit ibi, pr&aelig;sentibus priore
et monachis Sancti Jacobi de Bristollia, et magistro ac suis
fratribus Sancti Martii de ordin', cujus thema fuit: 'Videam
voluptatem Domini et visitem templum ejus.' (Psalm xxvi, 4.)
Et procuratus fuit eodem die sumptibus domus."</p>

<p>In the course of a visitation tour, Bishop Swinfield came
to Tenbury, in the archdeaconry of Salop and deanery of
Burford. The Norman abbey of Lyra held the great tithes;
the vicarial amounted to just one half of them, &pound;6. 13s. 4d.
The associate of the <i>dominus proctor</i>, who helped to manage the
revenues of the convent, was ready with his procuration for
the party. After visiting Burford, they came to Lindridge,
and visited the church, which had been both a rectory and
vicarage; these, however, upon the recent death of the late
vicar, Walter, in 1288, had been united under the present
rector, John de Buterlee (Bitterley), and were valued
jointly at &pound;13. 6s. 8d. per annum. The reason for this
proceeding, illustrative of the state of affairs in the church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
is expressly set forth in the instrument framed for that
purpose; that whereas it had been canonically provided that
ecclesiastical benefices should not be divided; and that such
as for certain causes had been divided, upon cessation of such
causes should on the first opportunity be restored to their
integrity, so that it should be one church, one rector; and
that no rector of a parish church should employ a vicar,
but be bound to serve it himself, as the cure thereof requires;
unless a dignity or prebend be annexed to the said church,
when the institution or creation of a vicar might be allowed.
And whereas he (John de Bitterley) professed himself ready
to reside personally on his church of Lindridge as the law
required, there being no reasonable cause why there should
be a vicar in the said church, the vicarage and rectory were
perpetually united with all rights and appurtenances, emolument,
burden, and cure. It may however be added, that
this integrity came again, within a few years, to be more
permanently violated by the appropriation of the great tithes
to the Prior and Convent of Worcester, by special grant of
the King, with consent of the Bishop of Hereford. Edward
wrote a letter to his chancellor in French, directing that it
might be translated into Latin, and sent by a clerk of the
chancery to the chapter of Hereford; another instance of
the employment of the French language in this reign. The
rector of Lindridge discharged his duty of procuration;
and on the following day (April 15) they moved forward
in the direction of Bewdley to Aka (Rock). The parishes to
which the visitor was directing his attention in this quarter
lay within a small compass. Master William Brun was
rector in 1276, and no subsequent incumbent has been
detected up to this year of visitation. The value of the
benefice was the same as that of Lindridge. Out of many
of these benefices payments were made in other quarters;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
as in this instance: the Prior of Ware was paid &pound;2. 13s. 4d.
and the Prior of Conches &pound;2. Out of Lindridge the Prior of
Worcester received &pound;6. 13s. 4d. Procuration was duly furnished
here; and this is the fifth day since any expense
on the part of the Bishop was incurred. On arriving at
Kinlet, the visiting party were obliged to have recourse to
Kidderminster for supplies. Robert the carter was the
purveyor; he had a guide to attend him, probably through
the intervening forest of Wyre, and paid for passing the
Severn on his way to and from the town.</p>

<p>I cannot conclude my notice of this interesting Manuscript
without strongly recommending my readers to possess
themselves of a copy of Mr. Webb's admirable publication.</p>


<h3>BISHOP SKINNER.</h3>

<p>"Memoirs of Dr. Robert Skinner, Bishop of Worcester,
who died 1670." Several manuscript volumes, in the handwriting
of the Right Rev. Dr. White Kennett, Bishop of
Peterborough, are to be found in the British Museum (MS.
Lansdown, 986, fol. 135), containing biographies of distinguished
ecclesiastics, one of whom was Bishop Skinner of
Worcester. This prelate was elected to the see of Bristol in
1636, translated to that of Oxford in 1641, and to Worcester
in 1663. While he lived in the times of usurpation, being
deprived of his see, he remained in his diocese comforting
his clergy, and ordaining those who were willing to enter
the church, and was supposed to be the sole bishop that
during that time conferred holy orders. Immediately after
his Majesty's return an hundred and three persons did at
once take holy orders from him in the Abbey Church at
Westminster. At his death it was computed that he had sent
more labourers into the vineyard than all his brethren he
then left behind him had done. His biographer observes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
that, in the see of Worcester, he became by his many tenants
more esteemed than family or friends because of his goodness
as a landlord. He died an octogenarian, and was buried in
a chapel at the east end of the choir of the Cathedral Church
at Worcester; over his grave was soon after laid a flat stone,
at the head of which are engraved the arms of his family,
impaled with those of the see, surmounted by a mitre, and
underneath is a long Latin inscription.</p>

<p>In the Bodleian Manuscript, Tanner 45, fol. 19, is a letter
to Sheldon, Archbishop of Canterbury, interesting, though
trivial, as applicable to the affairs of Worcester Cathedral.</p>

<p>"May it please your Grace,&mdash;Tandem aliquando I present your
grace with all the papers that make (and as with humble submission,
I conceive) are requisite in Mr. Deane of Worcester's defence against
Mr. Hathaway's pretences and allegations about the choire organ
made and fixt, and the great organ to be made, but now bargained
for. And the reason I sent these papers up no sooner was my
longing hope and endeavour to have made Mr. George Dallow's
testimonie more pregnant and evident touching the promise of
Hathaway and Dr. Gibbons to help him to this organ-worke at Worcester,
but, to my satisfaction, there is more than probabilitie there
had been monie enough to have satisfied Gibbons and Hathaway and
Talbott, had it been in the Deane's power to have made a bargain,
they well knew Mr. Deane's (Dr. Warmstrey) utter ignorance in re
musica. They knew he was, as it is in the Greek proverbe,
[Greek: onos pros lyran] &#959;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#962; &#955;&#965;&#961;&#945;&#957;, had no more skill in an organ than a beast that hath
no understanding, and 'tis very considerable that Hathaway should
dare to addresse a complaint at Council Board, when for above a
whole yeare, Mr. Deane having forbidden him to proceede to the
worke of the great organ, he never applied himselfe neither to Mr.
Deane nor to the Chapter, nor to the Visitor, continuing his visitacion
for nine months at least, no complaint all this while ever heard of,
and for y<sup>e</sup> materials provided it signifies nothing, unlesse it did
appeare they were provided for this organ, when soone after he had
made the choire organ he was forbidden to proceed any farther.
With Mr. Harrison (who was old Dallow's servant and married his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
daughter) I twice conferred about his testimonie, and he told me he
would make good all he said upon oath, and make it good to all the
organists in England, and if your grace shall secretly object, old
Hesiod's testimonie in y<sup>e</sup> case, [Greek: kai k&ecirc;ramius k&ecirc;ramei phthoneuei] &#954;&#945;&#953; &#954;&#951;&#961;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#965;&#962; &#954;&#951;&#961;&#945;&#956;&#949;&#953; &#966;&#952;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#949;&#953;, an
artist malignes his brother artist. I rely very much on Mr. Tomkin's
skill, bred in his cradle and all his life among organs, who is an
excellent organist, and has ever maintained an organ in his house,
his letter will show what his judgment was before this difference was
started. Little reason have I had to interpose in the least in Mr.
Deane's case, but I cannot forbear to stand up for innocence, though
joyned with much follie. I have returned a certificate to his
Majestie's instructions about hospitalls, and by the grace of God shall
returne a full answer to your grace's instructions about church
affaires in y<sup>e</sup> due time. The Lorde in the meane time preserve your

<p>The Bishop was cousin of Richard Skynner, of Cofton
Hackett, the eldest son of Edward Skinner, of Ledbury,
who purchased that manor for him from the Dyneley family,
upon his marriage with his first wife, Miss Dyneley; and of
Dr. William Skynner, his brother, fellow of All Soul's,
Oxford; 1612, LL.D. March 31; 1625, chancellor of Hereford,
April 29, 1626; rector of Beckenham, Kent, 1628; and in
1650 deprived of his living by the Parliament in favour of
John Soter, and never restored, as he died at Ledbury, 1657,
aged 66. This Richard's will showed, by his selection of
his executors, and the course pursued by them in the Civil
Wars, how friendships were broken; two, his brother-in-law,
Sir Edward Lyttleton, Baronet, and Sir Edward Sebright,
Baronet, were fined by Parliament as Royalists, and one was
Humphrey Salwey, also married to a Miss Lyttleton, whom
he styles his dear brother Humphrey Salwey, and whose son
sat as one of the judges on the trial of King Charles I,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
and was M.P. for Worcestershire in the Long Parliament. A
younger son of the Bishop's, William, was by his father
appointed rector of Hartlebury, and there is a monument to
his memory in that church. There was also another member
of the Ledbury family connected with this county, as having
been a member of the Oxford circuit, the Right Hon. Sir
John Skynner, Knight, Lord Chief Baron. He was grandson
of Edward Skynner, of Ledbury, and Margaret, his wife.
On the 15th March, 1757, he was one of the counsel present
in court, at the Worcester Assizes, when, between two and
three o'clock, p.m., as Sir Eardly Wilmot began to sum up
in the last cause, a stack of chimneys fell through the roof,
killing many. The counsel then in court, being five in number,
saved themselves under the stout table, and of these, four&mdash;Aston,
Nares, Ashurst, and Skynner&mdash;after became judges;
the fifth dying a king's counsel. We find traces of this old
Ledbury family in this county, for in Nash's History of
Worcestershire, vol. 2, we read that in the east window of
the south aisle of Little Malvern Church are the arms of
John Alcock, who was Bishop of Worcester from 1476 to
1486, and, in the south part of the same window is written
"Orate pro animabus Roberti Skinner et Isabell&aelig;, uxoris
ejus, et filiorum suorum et filiarum." Richard Skinner, of
Cofton, served the office of sheriff of Worcestershire in the
4th of Charles I (1628), and Edmund Skinner, of Wichenford,
in the 12th George I (1726). The arms of Skinner
are "Sable, a chevron or, between three griffins' heads
argent."</p>


<h3>DODDINGTREE HUNDRED TWO CENTURIES AGO.</h3>

<p>In Sir Thomas Winnington's library at Stanford is a bundle
of manuscripts, being a survey of the parsonages and other
church livings in the Doddingtree hundred of Worcestershire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>

Lord Protector Cromwell. These returns include thirty-three
parishes or places, namely, Bockleton, Pensax, Knighton-on-Teme

Mamble, Dodenham, Astley, and Shrawley. As an abstract of
some of the details may be interesting, I here present them.</p>

<p>The warrant from the Commissioners, dated October 20th of
the above year, required "fower or five sufficient inhabitants
of every parrish to enquier by all good wayes and meanes to
finde out the trueth and worth of the true value, by the yeare,
of church lyvinges, and the qualityes of the severall incumbants,"
&amp;c. Accordingly the presentments are signed by
constables, churchwardens, and, as it is quaintly expressed in
some instances, by "other knowinge men of the said parrish."
The Commissioners were "the Right Worship'le Edward
Pits, Esq., William Jeffreys, Esq., Nicholas Acton, Esq.,

have a decent chappell w'ch was heartofore (as wee are
informed) a free chauntery and had revenewes belonging to
it, to the value of &pound;200 p. ann. untill the same was transferred
to the Crowne by Acte of Parliament, made in the
raigne of King Edward the Sixte; since w'ch time the
minister of the said chappell hath had an allowance of eight
pounds p. ann. heartofore paied by the Auditors or Receivors
(out of the King's revenue) and now paied out of the Rectory
of Ombersley.</p>

<p>"That the said minnister before the incorporation of the
said towne was elected by the townesmen there, as wee are
informed, and since the incorporation theareof by the Bayliffe
and Capital Burgesses. That Mr. Henry Oseland is our
present minnister there in such sorte elected, who of right
can onely claime the said annuity of eight pounds, forth of
w'ch alsoe is deducted and the said minnister is forced to
allowe, for portage and taxes two and twenty shillings and
eight pence now by the yeare, and when assessments are
more the disbursement is greater (besides w'ch) he hath an
augmentation of fifty pounds p. ann. graunted to him soe
longe as hee officiats there.</p>

<p>"That the said towne is a populous markett towne, whearein
there are fifteene hundred or more fitt to be taught; that it
hath been reputed to be within the parrish of Ribsford, that
the parrish church is allmost a mile distant from the towne,
that Mr. John Borraston is rector theareof, and hath out of
our said borrough to the value of &pound;48. 15s. 8d. p. ann. or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
thereabouts. And the said Mr. Borraston nor his predecessors
have not given any mainetenance to the minnisters of the
chappell aforesaid, neither have had the choice of the
minnisters to yt place as wee have heard.</p>

<p>"Alsoe we humbly conceive there is a necessity that wee
should have both places continued and minnisters to supply
them for these reasons following:</p>

<p>"1. Because neither of the places will contayne the whole
people of the towne and parrish.</p>

<p>"2. Because of the inconveniences yt a whole towne should
goe neare a mile to the publick ordinance many being aged
sicke and weake, when there is a convenient chappell in the
midst of the said towne, that will contayne most of the people
there.</p>

<p>"3. Because the chappell hath had for neare 60 yeares
past praching minnisters successively (as we are credibly
informed) And now wee have in the chappell a very godly
man, well affected to the p'sent government, whom the
Lord hath made an instrument to bring in many soules
(wee hope) to Christ.</p>

<p>"4. Because of the greatness of the number of the people
the worke of the minnistery will be too much worke for one
man and the incombes of the p'sonage to little for the maintenance
of two minnisters, thearfore we shall humbly pray that
the augmentation of &pound;50 p. ann. alreaddy graunted with the
stipend of &pound;8 p. ann. may be made up a competent mainetenance
for the present minnister of the chappell and soe for
succession of minnisters there, w'ch being done will conduce
much to the glory of God and good of the place.</p>

<p>"Furthermore wee humbly desire that both the meetinge
places at Bewdley and Ribsford be kept up and each have its
p'ochall bounds fixed, the fittest and most convenientst way
(as we humbly conceive it) for the parrish of Ribsford to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
conteyne the whole Lordship of Ribsford entire, and the
division to be onely in the borrough as followeth.</p>

<p>"To begin at Seavern side where the towne liberties end;
w'ch is at the lower end of the Lady meadowes, and soe along
by Bewdley parke wall as its bounded by the Lordship of
Ribsford and soe about the parke end to John Monnop his
house at Blakemans Sitch; and from his house crossing the
way to the outside bounde of the lande belonging to John
Clare called Blakeman's Sitch; and soe from thence to Goodwater
Brooke, and then downe the brooke to Dowles Brooke
to the bounds betweene the Borrough and Dowles, down to
Seaverne-side to the bottome of the Lady meadowes where we
began.</p>

<p>"The tithes of yt parte w'ch belonge to the borrough wee
conceive fittest to be settled one ye minnisters at the chappell
(after ye decease of the p'sent incumbent at Ribsford), and
the tithes belonging to the parrish w'ch is cutt of from the
borrough may be continued to the minnister of Ribsford.</p>

<p>"Our reasons for the division thus made (amongst others)
are these.</p>

<p>"1. In this way provision will be made for each auditory
to have two sufficient congregations for two able men to
preach unto and allow for private inspection and oversight.</p>

<p>"2. In this way provision may be made for a competent
maintenance for two approved preachers in both parrishes if
the augmentation and the other supplies before-named be
continued and settled one the minnister at the said chappell.</p>

<p>"3. By this way the people that are devided from the
borrough and settled in Ribsford parrish are all (within a very
few houses) as nigh to Ribsford meetinge place as Bewdley
chappell and many neerer.</p>

<p>"4. In this way there is no devision of houses yt are
contiguous but those yt are united in one parrish and those yt
are scattered in the other parrish.</p>

<h2>Superstitions.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In all cases of preternatural pretensions a nice question must always
present itself&mdash;as to how many of the believers are fools, how many of
them knaves, and how many both one and the other."</p></div>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">In</span> some parts of this county the following things are
considered unlucky:</p>

<p>To meet a squinting woman, unless you speak to
her, which breaks the charm.</p>

<p>To go a journey on a Friday.</p>

<p>To be one of a party of thirteen at Christmas.</p>

<p>To have a cut onion lying about in the house breeds distemper.</p>

<p>To cross knives accidentally at meal times.</p>

<p>To walk under a ladder.</p>

<p>For the first young lamb you see in a season, or a colt,
to have its tail towards you.</p>

<p>To kill a lady-cow (in Dorsetshire called "God Almighty's
cow").</p>

<p>For a sportsman to meet an old woman when going out
shooting is a sure sign of bad sport.</p>

<p>To put the bellows on a table will evoke a quarrel.</p>

<p>To keep Christmas holly about the house after Candlemas
Day, in which case it is believed the Father of Evil will
come and pull it down himself.</p>

<p>To put salt on another person's plate at table. The superstition
that overturning salt at table is unlucky is said to
have originated with Leonardo da Vinci's picture of the
Last Supper, where Judas is represented as overturning the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
salt; but this little incident in the picture was more likely
the result than the cause of the superstition.</p>

<p>To see the first of the new moon through a window, or
glass of any sort, is also unlucky. But if you see it in the
open air, turn the money in your pocket, and express a
wish for luck during the ensuing month; you are supposed
to ensure it.</p>

<p>"Always kill your pig in the new moon, or the fat will
run," is an old saying.</p>

<p>It is unlucky to point to the moon, there being a notion
that the "man" who was transported to that satellite for
stealing sticks won't stand being pointed at.</p>

<p>To have a female come into your house the first thing on
New Year's morning. So extensively does this absurdity
prevail, that in many towns young lads make "a good thing
of it" by selling their services to go round and enter the
houses first that morning.</p>

<p>As to cutting your nails on a Sunday, the following couplet
is very expressive:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Better a child was never born<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than cut his hoofs of a Sunday."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is varied in some districts, thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>The itching of the nose is a sign of bad news, or, as some
have it, that "you will be kissed, cursed, or vexed, or shake
hands with a fool." If the ear itches, you may expect news
from the living; if the face burns, some one is talking about
you; when you shudder, a person is walking over the spot
where your grave will be; and if your foot itches it is a sign
you will tread on strange ground.</p>

<p>To make presents of knives or scissors will be sure to cut
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>off love or friendship; but if something is given in exchange,
it prevents this bad effect.</p>

<p>Babies must never have their nails cut, but bitten, to prevent
their becoming thieves.</p>

<p>To snuff out a candle accidentally entails the fate of not
getting married in the same year.</p>

<p>It is in the highest degree unlucky to give your neighbour a
light at Christmas time, or New Year's Day; and those who
have neglected to lay in a stock of matches at that season
often have to repent the oversight by being unable to light
their fires in the morning, and in most cases amongst the poor
neither prayers nor entreaties will induce them to part with
their fire.</p>

<p>At Mathon, some people believe that if land is left unsown
in a field, there will be a death in the family within the year;
and when the accident is discovered they do not sow it again
(see Mr. Watson's sketch of that parish).</p>

<p>Omens, or tokens of death, adhere to the popular belief
to a more general extent than any other relic of superstition,
perhaps one third of the population attaching more or less
credit to them. It would be impossible to enumerate all these
idle fancies, but among them are prominently the howling of a
dog, a winding sheet in the candle, and the issuing of light
from a candle after it is blown out.</p>

<p>A piece of curled tallow (winding sheet) on a candle has
been scarcely ever known to fail as prophetic of death in the
family or among friends.</p>

<p>When a single crow flies over you it is the sign of a
funeral; two are a certain prognostication of a wedding.</p>

<p>A bit of coal popped from the fire must resemble either a
purse or a coffin, and consequently good luck or death.</p>

<p>To have a long succession of black cards (spades or clubs)
dealt to a person while at play is prophetic of death to
himself or some member of the family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>When a corpse is limp, it is a sign that another death will
happen in the house.</p>

<p>To have apples and blossoms on a tree at the same time is
a sign of a forthcoming death in the family.</p>

<p>If a white bean grow in the garden it is a sure sign of
death.</p>

<p>Any appearance among plants in the garden not understood
is considered "a token." Thus a rose whose flower has
any leaves intermixed with the red petals, as sometimes
happens, is called a "death rose," and foretells death to some
of the family.</p>

<p>"A great year for nuts a great year for (the birth of)

<p>Tea-drinking is made to foreshadow a large number of the
casualties of life, including the receipt of presents, the visits
of strangers, obtaining sweethearts, and the like, merely from
the appearance of the tea and the "grounds" or settlement
in the cup.</p>

<p>To leave a teapot lid open undesignedly is an indication
that a stranger is coming; and when a cock crows in your
doorway, or a bit of black stuff hangs on the bar of the grate,
it is a sign of a similar event.</p>

<p>It is believed in many districts that some persons have

<p>The colliers at Dudley, in the event of a fatal accident to
one of their number, all in the same pit immediately cease

custom, more or less modified, prevails in many districts.</p>

<p>The "seventh son of a seventh son" is believed to be
endowed with extraordinary curative powers in certain
diseases, and the same with regard to a daughter under
similar circumstances.</p>

<p>In the vicinity of the Malvern hills there is a superstition
among the poorer people that when any one is bitten by a
viper&mdash;which reptile is occasionally to be met with in bushy
ground about the southern part of the range&mdash;if it can be
killed forthwith, an ointment made from its liver will be a
specific for the wound.</p>

<p>A "handsel," or first money received for an article sold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
if taken from a particular person or under particular circumstances,
Mr. Lees says, is supposed to be productive of good
luck; and some complain that they cannot do business for
want of a handsel from the person of whom they wish to
receive it.</p>

<p>In the year 1643, when some thieves plundered the house
of Mr. Rowland Bartlett, at Castle Morton, among other
things they took a "cock eagle stone, for which thirty pieces
had been offered by a physician, but refused." These eagle
stones were &aelig;tites, a variety of argillaceous oxide of iron;
they were hollow, with a kernel or nucleus, sometimes
moveable, and always differing from the exterior in colour
and density. The ancients superstitiously believed that this
pebble was found in the eagle's nest, and that the eggs could
not be hatched without its assistance. Many other absurd
stories were raised about this fossil.</p>

<p>The custom of burying exclusively on the south side of
churchyards prevails very generally in the rural districts of
this county, except where the smallness of the ground or
the extent of the population has rendered it compulsory to
use the north side, which, however, was formerly reserved
for suicides and strangers. Many fanciful theories have been
invented to account for this preference of the south side,
but the most probable is, that, as the principal entrance to
the church was usually on that side, it was natural for burials
to be there also, that the deceased might have the benefit
(so accounted in those days) of the prayers of the congregation
as they walked to and fro and beheld the inscriptions.</p>

<p>The very ancient custom of divination by the flight of
birds is not yet forgotten. The robin and wren are birds
of good augury: if a raven flies over a house, there will
soon be a corpse there. The number of magpies met with
as you set out on a journey indicates what is to happen:</p>

<p>Mr. Allies tells of a remarkable superstition that prevailed
not many years ago at Suckley, where the country people
used to talk a great deal about "The Seven Whistlers,"
and that they oftentimes at night heard six out of these
seven whistlers pass over their heads; but that no more than
six of them were ever heard at once, for when the seven
should whistle together there would be an end of the world.
This is supposed to have some reference to fairy lore, and is
still believed by the Leicestershire colliers, who, when they
hear "the whistlers," will not venture below ground, thinking
that death to some one is foreboded. The superstition has
probably a German origin.</p>

<p>Fern seed is supposed to make the gatherer walk invisible;
but as the fern is said to bloom and seed only at twelve
o'clock at Midsummer night, the seed can only be caught by
using twelve pewter plates; the seed will then pass through
eleven of the plates and rest on the twelfth.</p>

<p>There was formerly a "holy thorn" at Redmarley Farm,
Acton Beauchamp, but it was cut down a few years ago
because of the number of persons who went to see it. It is
stated that the person who cut it down broke his leg and
his arm soon afterwards, and the premises were burnt down.
A similar thorn may be seen (as Mr. Lees informs us) in
the hedge of a garden at Cherry Green, Alfrick.</p>

<p>A superstition exists in some parts of the county that if
pieces of the alder tree are carried in the waistcoat pocket
they will be a safeguard against rheumatism. In Wyre
Forest, near Bewdley, is a botanical curiosity, namely, the
celebrated old <i>Pyrus domestica</i>, said to be the only tree of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
the kind growing wild in England. It is of the same kind as
the "Rowan," or mountain ash, which was and even now is
vulgarly worn as a remedy against witchcraft. It is most
thought of by the common people, and there are various
traditions concerning it. The name given to the tree is
"the witty pear-tree"&mdash;the mountain ash being also called
"the whitty tree," and the leaves of this tree are very
similar. One of our Naturalist Field Clubs visited it in
August, 1853: vegetation was then entirely confined to its
top boughs, which however still held a few pears on them.
Some hermit, or reputed "wise man," probably planted this
tree, and derived part of his subsistence by distributing its
leaves and fruit, as a protection against witchcraft.</p>

<p>In April, 1856, a poor woman, residing in a village about
three miles from Pershore, acting upon the advice of her
neighbours, brought her child, who was suffering from
whooping cough, to that town, for the purpose of finding out
a married couple answering to the names of Joseph and Mary,
and soliciting their interference on behalf of her afflicted
child, as she had been informed that if two married persons
having those names could but be induced to lay their hands
on her child's head, the whooping cough would be immediately
cured. After scouring the town for a considerable time in
search of "Joseph and his fair lady," they were at length
discovered in the persons of a respectable tradesman and his
wife residing in Bridge Street, to whom the poor silly woman
made known her foolish request, which at first excited a smile
from the good woman of the house, but was quickly followed,
not by "the laying on of hands," but by good advice, such
as mothers only know how to give in these matters. The
poor mother then thankfully departed a wiser woman.</p>

<p>In the rural districts great faith is put in rings made of
the shillings and sixpences given at the sacrament, and many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
clergymen have told me of repeated applications having been
made to them for sacrament shillings, for the purpose of
keeping away the evil spirit, or as a remedy for fits. Mr.
Watson, in his History of Hartlebury, says that he believes
nearly every person in that district who was subject to fits
wore such a ring. And there is another parish in the county
where I am told even Protestant poor go to the Romanist
priest to have the relics of saints applied for the cure of
diseases.</p>

<p>The Worcester papers in the year 1845 recorded that a
person from this city, being on a visit to a friend about four
miles distant, had occasion to go into the cottage of a poor
woman, who had a child afflicted with the whooping-cough.
In reply to inquiries as to her treatment of the child, the
mother pointed to its neck, on which was a string fastened,
having nine knots tied in it. The poor woman stated that
it was the stay-lace of the child's godmother, which, if applied
exactly in that manner round about the neck, would be sure
to charm away the most troublesome cough!</p>

<p>An infallible recipe for the cure of ague is said to be the
following: Go to a grafter of trees, and tell him your complaint.
You must not give him any money, or there will
be no cure. You go home, and in your absence the grafter
cuts the first branch of a maiden ash, and the cure takes
place instantly on cutting the branch from the tree.</p>

<p>A Worcestershire woman was asked the other day why she
did not attend church on the three Sundays on which her
banns of marriage were proclaimed? She replied that she
should never dream of doing so unlucky a thing; and on
being questioned as to the kind of ill-luck that would have
been expected to have followed up her attendance at church,
she said that all the offspring of such a marriage would be
born deaf and dumb, and that she knew a young woman who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
would persist in going to church to hear her banns "asked
out," and whose six children were in consequence all deaf
and dumb!</p>

<p>At a certain country church in Worcestershire, on a Sunday
early in 1856, there were three christenings, two boys and
a girl. The parents of one boy were in a very respectable
class of life; the parents of the two other children were in
humble circumstances. The parties at the font had been duly
placed by the officiating clergyman, and as it happened, the
girl and sponsors were placed last in order. When the first
child&mdash;who was the boy of the poor parents&mdash;was about to be
baptized, the woman who carried the little girl elbowed her
way up to the clergyman, in order that the child she carried
might be the first to be baptized. To do this she had (very
contrary to the usual custom of the poor, who, in essential
points, are generally as refined as their superiors) to rudely
push past "her betters"&mdash;<i>i. e.</i> the sponsors of the second boy.
As she did so she said to one of the sponsors&mdash;by way of
apology&mdash;"It's a girl; so it <i>must</i> be christened first;" and
christened first it was. But the peculiar manner in which this
was brought about showed that the woman was influenced by
some curious feeling; and on the next day, an opportunity
was taken to discover her motive. This was her explanation:
"You see, sir, the parson bain't a married man, and consequentially
is disfamiliar with children, or he'd a never put
the little girl to be christen'd after the boys. And though it
sadly flustered me, sir, to put myself afore my betters in the
way which I was fosed to do; yet, sir, it was a doing of a
kindness to them two little boys, in me a setting of my girl
afore 'em." "Why?" "Well, sir! I <i>har</i> astonished as <i>you</i>
don't know. Why, sir, if them little boys had been christened
afore the little girl, <i>they'd</i> have had <i>her</i> soft chin, and <i>she'd</i>
have had <i>their</i> hairy beards&mdash;the poor little innocent! But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
thank goodness! I've kep her from that misfortin!" And
the woman really believed that she had done so; and the
generality of her neighbours shared her belief. Let this be
a warning to clergymen, more especially to bachelors, who
would stand well in the opinions of their poorer parishioners!</p>



<h3>BELLS</h3>

<p>were formerly a prolific source of superstition. There is
a valley in Nottinghamshire, where a village is said to have
been swallowed up by an earthquake, and it was the custom
on Christmas Day morning for the people to assemble in this
valley and listen to the fancied ringing of the church bells
underground. At Abbot's Morton there is a tradition that
the silver bells belonging to the abbot are buried in the site
of his old residence there. At Ledbury, a legend relates
that St. Katharine had a revelation that she was to travel
about, and not rest at any place, till she heard the bells
ringing of their own accord. This was done by the Ledbury
bells on her approaching that town. When the church at
Inkberrow was rebuilt on a new site in ancient days, it was
believed that the fairies took umbrage at the change, as
they were supposed to be averse to bells; they accordingly
endeavoured to obstruct the building, but, as they did not
succeed, the following lamentation was occasionally heard by
the startled rustics:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Neither sleep, neither lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Inkbro's ting-tangs hang so nigh."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Many years ago the twelve parish churches in Jersey each
possessed a beautiful and valuable peal of bells; but during
a long civil war, the states determined on selling these bells
to defray the heavy expenses of their army. The bells were
accordingly collected and sent to France for that purpose;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
but, on the passage, the ship foundered, and everything was
lost, to show the wrath of Heaven at the sacrilege. Since
then, before a storm, these bells ring up from the
deep; and to this day the fishermen of St. Ouen's Bay
always go to the edge of the water before embarking, to
listen if they can hear "the bells upon the wind;" and, if
those warning notes are heard, nothing will induce them to
leave the shore; if all is quiet they fearlessly set sail. As
a gentleman, who has versified the legend, says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Tis an omen of death to the mariner,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who wearily fights with the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the foaming surge is his winding sheet,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And his funeral knell are we:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His funeral knell our passing bell,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And his winding sheet the sea."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<h3>GOOD FRIDAY</h3>

<p>is the occasion of great superstition. It is believed that
anything planted on that day will prosper, and that if the
seeds of the stock are sown in the evening, as the sun goes
down, the flowers will be sure to come double. Hot-cross
buns, or other bread made on a Good Friday, are supposed
never to grow mouldy, and if kept for twelve months and
then grated into some liquor, will prove a great soother of
the stomach-ache; acorns dried and grated will have the same
effect. The origin of the buns was the consecrated loaf made
from the dough, whence the host itself was formerly taken and
given by the priests to the people; they were marked with
the cross, as our Good Friday buns are. The superstitious
frequently preserved Good Friday buns from year to year,
from the belief of their efficacy in the cure of diseases. And
Poor Robin, in his Almanack for 1753, says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Whose virtue is, if you'll believe what's said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They'll not grow mouldy like the common bread."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>
<p>The poorer people of Offenham will by no means allow any
washing to be about on a Good Friday, which would be considered
the forerunner of much ill-luck. At Cutnal Green
it is thought that if you do not empty your lie tub on Good
Friday, you will have bad luck in the ensuing year.</p>


<h3>BEES.</h3>

<p>In many places in this county, when the master of a family
dies, the old nurse goes to the hive of bees, knocks, and says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The master's dead, but don't you go;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your mistress will be a good mistress to you."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A bit of black crape is then pinned to the hive. It is firmly
believed that but for this precaution the bees would all desert
the place. A correspondent at Pershore says: "While conversing
with a farmer's wife in this neighbourhood, I was
gravely informed that it was certainly the truth, unless the
bees were 'told' when anybody died in the house, something
would happen either to bees or honey before long.
She considered it a great want of foresight not to go from
the house in which the 'departed one' had breathed his or
her last to the hive without delay, and 'tell the bees' what
had happened." In some places the custom is to take the
key of the front door to the hive and tap it gently, saying,
"Bees, bees, your master (or mistress) is dead." The hives
also are usually covered with crape. If a swarm of bees
return to their old hive, it is believed that a death will
happen in the family within the year. This superstition probably
prevails nearly all over the kingdom, and is believed
to be of great antiquity. In Oxfordshire, it is said that if a
man and his wife quarrel, the bees will leave them. In
Devonshire, the custom is (or was in the year 1790) to turn
round the bee-hives that belonged to the deceased at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
moment the corpse was being carried out of the house; and
on one occasion, at the funeral of a rich old farmer at Collumpton,
as a numerous procession was on the point of
starting, a person called out, "Turn the bees;" upon which
a servant, who had no knowledge of the custom, instead of
turning the hives about, lifted them up, and then laid them
down on their sides. The bees, thus invaded, quickly fastened
on the attendants, and in a few moments the corpse
was left quite alone, hats and wigs were lost in the confusion,
and a long time elapsed before the sufferers returned
to their duty.</p>


<h3>CHARMS</h3>

<p>are still believed in to a great extent among the poor. In the
neighbourhood of Hartlebury they break the legs of a toad,
sew it up in a bag alive, and tie it round the neck of the
patient. There were lately some female charmers at Fladbury.
The peasantry around Tenbury and Shrawley have also great
faith in charms, and the toad remedy is applied at the former
place, the life or death of the patient being supposed to be
shadowed forth by the survival or death of the poor animal.
At Mathon, old women are intrusted with the cure of burns
by charming, which they do by repeating a certain number of
times the old doggrel rhyme, beginning&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There were two angels came from the north," &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the neighbourhood of Stoke Prior a charm was some time
ago used by a labouring man for the removal of the thrush (or
"throcks" as it is locally termed) in children: he would put
his finger into his mouth, and then into that of the child,
rubbing the gums, while he mumbled out something terminating
with "Father, Son, and Holy Ghost," then put down
the child without speaking another word, and leave the house
without eating or drinking. Charming for the toothache is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
still customary at Cutnall Green. The charm is written on
paper, and sealed up, which the afflicted person carries about
with him, and it is believed to be a sure cure. A "poke" or
wart on the eye is "charmed away" by rubbing it with a
wedding ring. Drinking out of a sacramental cup is considered
a cure for the hooping cough. A pillow, filled with
hops and laid under the patient's bed, is an undoubted cure
for rheumatism. This charm was prescribed to George III
by a physician at Reading, recommended by Lord Sidmouth,
and administered to the royal patient accordingly.</p>

<p>The following lines are very generally taught to children in
the rural districts, to say at night with their prayers:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bless the bed that I lie on;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are four corners to my bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are four angels round my head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One to watch, and one to pray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And two to carry my soul away."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<h3>TOUCHING FOR THE KING'S EVIL</h3>

<p>was in old times an established institution. In 1666 the
Chamberlain of the Worcester Corporation spent &pound;10. 14s.
in an entertainment to Mr. Gratrix, "an Irishman famous
for helping and curing many lame and diseased people only
by stroking of their maladies with his hand, and therefore
sent for to this and many other places." Valentine Gratrix&mdash;surnamed
the Stroker&mdash;was a great proficient and master
of the art; and by a letter of his (still in existence) to the
Archbishop of Dublin, it appears that he believed himself
to be inspired by God for the purpose of curing this disease.
He was entertained with great hospitality at many of our
citizens' houses, and was thus fortunate in having a long
start of the mesmerizers of the present day. The parish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
register of Chaddesley Corbett contains a "Mem. That Nov.
24, 1685, a certificate was granted to Gervase Burford, to be
touched for the King's evil;" and two years later King
James II was at Worcester, and attended at the Cathedral
for the purpose of touching persons affected with the evil.
From the Worcestershire county records it appears that in
1688 one Susannah Rose petitioned the Court of Quarter
Sessions on behalf of her brother, George Gilbert, a blacksmith,
of Stourbridge, upon whose toes a hammer having
fallen, had disabled him from work, and "after much suffering
he was persuaded it was gone to the King's evil, went to
London, and was touched by his Majesty, but afterwards was
forced to go to a surgeon, at Rushock, under cure for above
half-a-year, when he left him off, and would not let him be
entertained in the parish any longer," and the poor petitioner
being unable to provide for him, prays for his settlement at
Bellbroughton, where he was born and apprenticed. In the
parish records of St. Nicholas, it is stated that in 1711, one
Walker, a pauper, was sent to London to be touched; and I
believe that Dr. Johnson was touched by Queen Ann, as late
as 1712. In the reign of Charles II a royal proclamation
was issued stating the time when that monarch would touch
persons afflicted with this disease. A broadside containing
a printed copy of this proclamation still exists at Painswick,
in Gloucestershire, in the possession of Mr. Gyde, the surgeon
there. William of Malmesbury, who flourished in the twelfth
century, alleges the origin of the Royal touch to have been
on this wise: a young married woman, having some enormous
glandular swellings on her neck, was admonished in a dream
to have it washed by the King (Edward the Confessor). His
Majesty readily fulfilled this labour of love by rubbing her
neck with his fingers dipped in water, and before a week had
expired, the tumour subsided and a fair new skin covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
the affected part, so that a perfect cure was the result&mdash;and
not only that, but the woman, who had been previously
childless, in less than another year became the mother of
twins, which (the sage chronicler gravely remarks) "greatly
increased the admiration of Edward's holiness. Those who
knew him more intimately affirm that he often cured this complaint
in Normandy; whence appears how false is their notion
who in our times assert that the cure of this disease does
not proceed from personal sanctity but from hereditary virtue
in the Royal line."</p>


<h3>WITCHCRAFT.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"A thousand fantasies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Begin to throng on my memory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of calling shapes and beck'ning shadows dire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And aery tongues, that syllable men's names<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On sands and shores and desert wildernesses."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A lingering belief in witchcraft still remains among the
most ignorant of our population, both rural and urban. Some
particulars relative to the existence of this superstition in
this county in the seventeenth century will be found among
the county records in the early part of this volume. The law
against witchcraft, passed in the time of James I, being very
stringent, the driving out evil spirits, allaying of ghosts, and
abjuring witches, became, for nearly a century, a profitable
employment. Witch-finders existed as public officers; and
beside the public executions which disgraced every assizes,
multitudes of accused were destroyed by popular resentment,
while others were drowned by the test applied, for if, on being
thrown into the water, they did not sink, they were presumed
witches, and either killed on the spot or reserved for burning
at the assizes. In the year 1649, four persons were tried at
Worcester for this supposed offence, and all were executed,
<i>two of them confessing their crime</i>, viz.: Margaret Landis and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
Susan Cook; Rebecca West and Rose Holybred died obstinate.
The custom at Worcester was to duck the accused in the
Severn (Cooken Street, or "Cucken Street," as it is spelt in
some old maps, being no doubt the line of route on these
occasions).</p>

<p>Baxter, in his "World of Spirits," speaks of those men
who told of things stolen and lost, and who showed the face
of a thief in a glass, and caused the goods to be brought
back, who were commonly called "white witches." "When
I lived (he says) at Dudley, Hodges, at Sedgley, two miles
off, was long and commonly accounted such a one; and when
I lived at Kederminster, one of my neighbours affirmed that,
having his yarn stolen, he went to Hodges, ten miles off, and
he told him that at such an hour he should have it brought
home again and put in at the window, and so it was; and as
I remember he showed him the person's face in a glass. Yet
I do not think that Hodges made any known contract with
the devil, but thought it an effect of art."</p>

<p>About the year 1672 a prebend of Worcester (Joseph
Glanville) seriously wrote a book, entitled, "Some considerations
touching the being of Witches and Witchcraft," which
engaged him in a controversy that lasted as long as his life.
The statute 9th George II, chap. 5 (1736), at length repealed
the disgraceful Witch Act, and stopped all legal prosecutions
against persons charged with conjuration, sorcery, &amp;c.; yet
what has once taken so firm a hold of the popular mind is
not to be so easily eradicated; and Dr. Nash, who wrote his
"Worcestershire" towards the close of the last century,
asserts that not many years previously a poor woman, who
happened to be very ugly, was almost drowned in the neighbourhood
of Worcester, upon a supposition of witchcraft;
and had not Mr. Lygon, a gentleman of singular humanity
and influence, interfered in her behalf, she would certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
have been drowned, upon a presumption that a witch could
not sink. Later still, Mr. Allies informs us, that when the
late Mr. Spooner kept a pack of hounds, whenever they passed
through a certain field in Leigh Sinton, the hounds would
invariably run after something which nobody could see, until
they came to the cottage of an old woman named Cofield,
when they would turn back again, the old witch having then
got safely into her own "sanctum." The exploits of Mrs.
Swan, of Kidderminster, who pretended to discover stolen
property for everybody else except what she herself had lost,
and who died in an awfully tempestuous night in November,
1850, when her cats so mysteriously disappeared, cannot yet
be forgotten; nor the recent existence of "the wise man
of Dudley," and many others of the same class, though
not quite so celebrated, who are now living. Some of the
Mathon people still believe that witchcraft makes their
pigs waste away; and, when convinced of the fact, they
kill the animal, and burn a part of the flesh, to prevent
any ill effects to those who eat the remainder. Mr. Lees
informs us of a pear tree in Wyre Forest, the fruit of which
is even now hung up in the houses of the peasantry as a
protection against witchcraft. The witch elm (<i>Ulmus montana</i>)
was the one commonly employed for the purpose,
as most easily attainable. That was <i>good</i>; the mountain ash
or witten tree was <i>better</i>; and the sorb tree or true service
(<i>Pyrus domestica</i>) was the <i>strongest</i> of all. Nine withes of
witch hazel, banded together, is used as a rustic appliance to
guard against witching influence. There is a place called
"Witchery Hole," in Little Shelsley, concerning which,
whenever a violent wind blows from the north, the people
say, "The wind comes from Witchery Hole," insinuating
that certain "broomstick hags" had something to do with
raising the wind. For a baker to cross the flour before he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
commences baking is regarded as a security against the witch
entering the bread. The horse-shoe is still seen over doors,
in many places, and fastened to bedsteads to keep witches
away. At the Police Office, at Stourbridge, only a few months
ago, a woman named Wassall charged a Mrs. Cartwright, a
poor woman afflicted with paralysis, with threatening to do
her some bodily injury. The defendant alleged that the
affliction under which she was suffering was caused by the
complainant, who had bewitched her; and that when she
begged her to remove the spell, complainant told her it had
been upon her for twelve weeks, and it should continue six
weeks longer. Finding entreaties vain, the defendant made
use of some idle threat, which led to the summons. A
"charm" was shown to the Court, which the deluded creature
had worn by the advice of a "wise" man to remove the spell;
it was a small black silk bag, containing pieces cut out from
the Prayer Book and Bible, and some hair, evidently from a
cat's back. The Bench endeavoured to assuage the fears of
the poor woman, and told her not to impute her affliction to
the evil machinations of any one, at the same time severely
lecturing the complainant for practising such deceit upon an
ignorant and afflicted fellow-creature.</p>

<p>There were reputed witches at Malvern in the last generation;
and at Colwall the common people are said even
now to dislike peewits (lapwings) which visit that place,
believing that their cry is "bewitch'd, bewitch'd;" and
should any person capture one of these birds he is strongly
recommended not to keep it for fear of misfortune or
accident. Peewits are believed to be departed spirits who
still haunt the earth in consequence of something that
troubles them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>


<h3>GHOSTS.</h3>

<p>At Beoley, about half a century ago, the ghost of a reputed
murderer managed to keep undisputed possession of a certain
house, until a conclave of the clergy chained him to the bed
of the Red Sea for fifty years. When that term was expired
the ghost reappeared (two or three years ago), and more than
ever frightened the natives of the said house&mdash;slamming the
doors, and racing through the ceilings. The inmates, however,
took heart, and chased him, by stamping on the floor
from one room to another, under the impression that, could
they once drive him to a trap-door opening into the cheese-room
(for which, if the ghost happened to be a rat, he had a
very natural <i>penchant</i>), he would disappear for a season. The
beadle of the parish, who also combined with that office the
scarcely less important one of pig-sticker, declared to the
writer that he dared not go by the house now in the morning
till the sun was up. (It was an ancient superstition that evil
spirits flew away at cock-crowing.)</p>

<p>The Droitwich Canal, in passing through Salwarpe, is said
to have cut off a slice of a large old half-timbered structure
supposed to have been formerly a mansion-house; and in
revenge for this act of mutilation, the ghost of a former
occupier revisits his old haunts, affrights the domestics, and
may be seen on dark nights, with deprecatory aspect, glide
down the embankment, and suicidally commit himself to the
waters below.</p>

<p>The Little Shelsley people will have it that the Court-house
in that parish is haunted, and that a Lady Lightfoot,
who was said to have been imprisoned and murdered in the
house, comes at night and drives a carriage and four fiery
horses round some old rooms that are unoccupied, and that
her ladyship's screams are sometimes heard over the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
Court. She has likewise been seen to drive her team into
the moat, when the whole disappeared, the water smoking
like a furnace.</p>

<p>Many of the ancient manor-houses of Worcestershire have
similar superstitions. At Huddington, there is an avenue of
trees, called "Lady Winter's Walk," where the lady of
Thomas Winter, who was obliged to conceal himself on
account of the share he had in the Gunpowder Plot, was in
the habit of awaiting her husband's furtive visits; and here
the headless spectre of her ladyship is still seen occasionally
pacing up and down beneath the sombre shade of those aged
trees. A headless female also appears at Crowle brook, by
which it would seem that the poor heart-broken lady sometimes
extended her visits.</p>

<p>At Leigh, a spectre, known as "Old Coles," formerly
appeared, and at dead of night, with <i>vis insana</i>, would drive
a coach and four down a part of the road, dash over the great
barn at Leigh Court, and then cool the fiery nostrils of his
steeds in the waters of the Teme. Mr. Jabez Allies also
records that this perturbed spirit was at length laid in a
neighbouring pool by twelve parsons, at twelve at night, by
the light of an inch of candle; and as he was not to rise
again until the candle was quite burnt out, it was therefore
thrown into the pool, and, to make all sure, the pool was
filled up&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"And peaceful ever after slept Old Coles's shade."
</p>

<p>This Coles (as is recorded by Mr. Lees) was on intimate
terms with a neighbour at Cradley, and being distressed for
want of money, heard that his friend was going to Worcester
to receive a large sum, and thereupon waylaid him on his
return by night. Coles seized the bridle and threatened
his friend's life; but the Cradley yeoman drew his sword<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
and made a furious cut, which freed him at once from the
robber, and he rapidly rode home; on his arrival there he
found a bloody hand firmly grasping his horse's bridle, and
one of the fingers bore the signet ring of his friend Coles.
Next day he went to Leigh, and found Coles in bed; he
acknowledged his crime, and begged for mercy, which was
granted in consideration of his awful punishment.</p>

<p>At Astwood Court, once the seat of the Culpepers, was an
old oak table, removed from the side of the wainscot in 1816,
respecting which tradition declares that it bore the impress
of the fingers of a lady ghost, who, probably tired of appearing
to no purpose, at last struck the table in a rage, and vanished
for ever; but the ghost was also in the habit of walking from
the house to "the cloven pear-tree."</p>

<p>At Holt Castle, it was not long ago believed by the servants
that a mysterious lady in black occasionally walked at dead
of night in a certain passage near to the attics; and likewise
that the cellar had been occupied by an ill-favoured bird
like a raven, which would sometimes pounce upon any person
who ventured to approach a cask for drink, and having
extinguished the candle with a horrid flapping of wings,
would leave its victim prostrated with fright. A similar
legend prevails at Leigh Court. A solution has been given
to this legend, however, which would imply a little cunning
selfishness on the part of the domestics who had the care
of the ale and cider dep&ocirc;t.</p>


<h3>LOVE SPELLS.</h3>

<p>A correspondent at Cutnall Green says that it is believed
there that for a single female to sleep in a new pair of shoes
and stockings is a sure means of her dreaming of her future
husband; and for a female to sleep with a breast bone, knife
and fork, and a plate, carefully put under her bolster, also
is sure to make her dream of her lover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>Another informant&mdash;a lady, who forgot to state the place
of her residence&mdash;sends me the following: If a maiden
wishes to know her future husband, let her on Midsummer Eve,
at midnight, descend backwards from her bed-room to the
garden, and, still walking backwards around it, and scattering
hemp seed with her right hand as she goes, repeat these lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hemp seed I sow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hemp seed is to mow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the man that my husband is to be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him follow after and mow,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>when he will suddenly appear with a scythe in his hand, which,
unless the poor damsel be particular in keeping her right
hand stretched out, may prove a dangerous weapon. Also on
Midsummer Eve, take two flowers called among the country
people "Midsummer Men," and planting them in the thatch,
repeat your own and sweetheart's name. Should they grow,
a wedding is certain, but if not, the lovers will be parted.
On All Saints, commonly called "All Hallows," let a young
woman take a ball of new worsted, and holding the end in her
fingers, throw the ball through the window (at midnight)
saying, "Who holds?" the man who is to be her husband will
pick up the worsted, mention his name, and disappear. On
Christmas Eve, let three, five, or seven young girls take each
a sprig of rosemary and place it in a bowl of water, putting
the vessel in the centre of the room. Stretch a string across
directly before it, hanging thereon a white garment of each
person. They must then sit speechless until the witching hour
of midnight, when each of their lovers will appear and take
a piece of rosemary out of the basin, and mention his own
name and his sweetheart's. When the first new moon in the
year appears, she may go to the garden, and looking steadily at
it, say&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"New moon, new moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Tell unto me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which of these three is my husband to be,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>mentioning the names of three young men, and curtseying to
each one. When next she sees them, let her notice if they
have their backs or faces towards her. The one who has his
face towards her will be her husband. Hang a peapod containing
nine peas over the doorway; the young man who
passes under it first (not one of the family) will be the husband
of the young woman who hangs it there. When a young girl
receives a letter from her lover, let her pin it in nine folds
and place it next her heart, on retiring to rest. If she dream
of gold or jewellery, he is sincere in his professions; if not, let
her beware. Take a ring and hang it upon one of your own
hairs, hold it steadily over a wine glass half full of water,
and wish to know how many years it will be before you are
married. As many times as it hits against the side of the
glass, so many years it will be before you are joined in
holy wedlock.</p>

<p>If a girl pluck a rose on Midsummer Eve, and wear it on
the succeeding Christmas Day, whatever single man takes it
from her must marry her.</p>

<p>To ascertain whether a pretended lover is sincere, take an
apple-pip, and naming one of your followers, put the pip on
the fire: if it make a noise in bursting it is a proof of love;
if there is no crack, it is a sign that he has no regard for
you:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If you love me, bounce and fly;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you hate me, lie and die."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another charm consists in sticking pips upon the cheek, and
naming several lovers, the truest being shown by that which
remains longest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>Fingered leaves are supposed to have a magical character.
If the terminating leaflets of the common ash are <i>even</i> (they
being usually <i>odd</i>) they bring "luck or a lover."</p>

<p>The herb Paris, a common plant in thick woods, has very
frequently its four leaves multiplied into five or six, and thus
generally gets the name of <i>true love</i>. So the common
Cinquefoil, called "Five-leaved grass," from having its leaves
in five digitated divisions, are made six or seven by accessory
leaflets, and the following rhyme is repeated in rural places:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Five-leaved grass, with six leaves on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Put it under your pillow, and you'll dream of your mon."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A powerful love-spell is produced by what is called the
"Speechless hawthorn." In May or June a flowering branch
of the hawthorn must be silently gathered in the evening, and
the maiden gathering it must refrain from speech that night,
as a single word spoken would break the spell. Hastening
to bed as soon as possible, speechless she must place the
hawthorn branch under her pillow, and then, in the visions
of the night, the man whom fate has destined for her future
husband will certainly present himself.</p>

<p>The common brake fern (<i>Pteris aquilina</i>), cut in two
obliquely, shows the initial letters of a sweetheart's name.</p>

<p>Get a maiden egg, carefully break it, and fill half the shell
with salt; then eat the salt as you go to bed, walking up
stairs backwards, and backing into bed also; be sure and
keep silence and you will dream of your lover: if he should
offer a glass of water he will be a poor man; if a glass of
wine, a gentleman.</p>

<p>On some Friday night go to bed, and put your shoes under
your pillow, crossing the left shoe over the right, and say&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"On this blessed Friday night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I put my left shoe o'er my right,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
<span class="i0">In hopes this night that I may see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The man that shall my husband be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his apparel and in his array,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the clothes he wears every day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What he does and what he wears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what he'll do all days and years;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether I sleep or whether I wake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hope to hear my true love speak."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Silence must be preserved till the morning, when the lover is
expected to appear in a dream.</p>

<p>Another love spell is "the dumb cake." This cake must
be made on New Year's Eve, and eaten in silence by a
number of young girls; one of them must place a clean
chemise, turned inside out, on a chair before the fire; this
must be sprinkled with water by a branch of rosemary; all
must then sit round the fire in silence till twelve o'clock. If
any among the party wish to be married during the ensuing
year, the form of her husband will approach the fire and turn
the chemise.</p>

<h2>Legends and Traditions.</h2>

</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> legends of Worcestershire, as of most other
counties, are mainly traceable to middle-age ecclesiastical
influences or to the popular ideas of the
author of all evil. Some few are derived from an exaggerated
recollection of historical facts, and a still smaller number
have descended to us from pagan times. Of these, with
others whose origin is buried in obscurity, I shall now proceed
to give a sample.</p>

<p>Ribbesford church contains an ancient sculpture on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
tympanum of its principal doorway, representing an archer,
with a doe or some other animal near him, which he has
apparently shot at, but missing his aim, the arrow passes
through what some have supposed to be a salmon, others a
seal or a beaver; and the legend is, that Robin of Horsehill,
the ranger to the manor, went out to shoot a buck, but incontinently
pierced a salmon in the river. It is probable, however,
in accordance with the known custom of the Norman
builders, that the sculpture is merely intended to represent
the leading feature of the locality, where an abundance of
game was to be procured, the occupants of the manor being
bound to furnish sporting for the monks of Worcester. Mr.
Lees says that only recently another sculpture has been
discovered at this church which seems to establish the proof
that they are symbolical in design.</p>

<p>In the sandstone blocks lying in Whelpley and Sapey brooks,
on the borders of this county and Herefordshire, are indentations
which are accounted for in this way. St. Katharine
and her maid Mabel (who ultimately took up their abode at
Ledbury in consequence of having heard the bells of that
town ring of their own accord), while travelling, had their
mare and colt stolen, upon which the saint prayed that
wherever the animals and the thief trod, the marks of their
feet might be left, as a means of tracing them. The thief,
it seems, was a girl in pattens, who took the animals down
several brooks to avoid detection, and hence the marks of
patten-rings and horses' feet visible to this day. Science,
however, cold-blooded and unfeeling, has declared, by the
mouth of Messrs. Murchison and Buckland, that the cavities
alluded to are void spaces from which concretions of marlstone
and other matter have been worked out by the action of
the water. It has been subsequently urged by other geologists
that these indentations were old water-marks made on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
shore when the consolidated "old red" was an ancient sea
beach, that they were filled up with soft marly matter, which
in modern times was washed away by the continued action of
streams in flowing among the stones, and thus the simulated
mare and colt's tracks became evident. Two of them, at a
place called Jumper's Hole, are very conspicuous, but it is
certain that they have been deepened year after year by
the action of the water that covers them in time of flood.
Between Clifton-on-Teme and Stanford Bishop the best
specimens may be seen.</p>

<p>The legend of St. Werstan, the founder of an oratory at
Great Malvern, was detailed by Mr. Albert Way in the
Journal of the Arch&aelig;ological Institute, in 1845, and illustrations
given from the ancient painted glass in the third window
of the clerestory, north of the choir in Malvern Abbey
church. The glass was probably executed towards the close
of the fifteenth century, when a part of the structure was
renovated. The first subject represents the hermit, under
the guidance of angels, indicating the spot for the erection
of an oratory, then the angels are seen dedicating the building,
next is a figure of Edward the Confessor granting a charter,
and lastly the saint is undergoing martyrdom at the hands
of two executioners armed with swords, and the choristers
or youths belonging to the establishment are being punished
by similar tormentors. The series is highly curious, and
seems unaccountably to have escaped notice before.</p>

<p>Our neighbours, the Danes, when they piratically infested
this country and plundered and burnt so large a number of
churches, were sometimes caught <i>in flagrante delicto</i>, and
their sacrilegious crimes were punished by flaying&mdash;their
skins being nailed on church doors, as a terror to all other
evil doers. The late Dr. Prattinton, of Bewdley, in his
Manuscripts now in the possession of the Society of Anti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>quaries,
states that some old doors then in the crypt of
Worcester Cathedral were covered with fragments of human
skin said to have belonged to a man who had stolen the
sanctus-bell from the high altar. Portions of this skin have
been since examined microscopically by Mr. Quekett, of the
Museum of the College of Surgeons, and pronounced decidedly
to be human. I have myself examined some old doors in the
crypt and found on them patches of a substance like leather,
of which I have a specimen now in my possession; but if
it ever belonged to a Dane it affords substantial proof that
they could not have been a thin-skinned race.</p>

<p>Similar specimens have been discovered at Westminster
Abbey, and the churches of Hadstock and Copford, Essex;
and Pepys, in his Diary (1661) mentions having seen Danes'
skins on the great doors of Rochester Cathedral.</p>

<p>Evesham Abbey is said to have derived its origin from the
same means which have been assigned to many other religious
establishments&mdash;namely, supernatural interposition. Eoves,
a swineherd, was attending his pigs in the forest on the site
of which Evesham now stands, when the Virgin appeared to
him in a vision, which he communicated to his master, the
Bishop of Worcester. The Bishop repaired to the place,
and saw a repetition of the vision, the Virgin enjoining him
not only to erect a monastery on that spot but to prepare
an image of herself, which was to be worshipped at Worcester.
This prelate, in atonement for the sins of himself and the
people, bound himself with chains, locked them together,
and threw the key into the Avon, declaring that nothing
but Divine interposition should loose his chains. Then he
undertook a pilgrimage to Rome, where his servant, purchasing
a fish for dinner, found in it the key which had been
thrown away; and so they returned triumphantly to Evesham.</p>

<p>St. Kenelm's chapel, on the Clent Hill, near Stourbridge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
has also its legend. Kenulph, King of Mercia, who died in
819, left his young son Kenelm under the protection of his
sister Quendreda, who, however, being ambitious for the
throne, procured her lover, Askobert, to take the youth out
hunting, and there, in a secluded valley, he cut off his head,
and buried him. However, a dove dropped a scroll on the
high altar at Rome, whereon was written a couplet giving
information of the murder:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In Clent Coubath, Kenelm, kinbarne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ly'th under thorne, heaued bereaved."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The lovers accordingly met with their desert, the murdered
King was canonized, and on the spot of his murder a chapel
was erected, and a spring of holy water burst forth which
for many centuries proved an undoubted specific for sore
legs and eyes, and a tolerably good source of emolument to
the ecclesiastics.</p>

<p>The old church of St. Clement's, Worcester, stood on the
eastern side of the Severn, close to the city wall; and the
legend says, that it was begun to be built on the side of the
river where the parish lies, but that angels, by night, took
away the stones to the place where the church was afterwards
erected. Modifications of this old tale, as also of the following,
may be met with in almost every town. The original spire of
St. Andrew's church is said to have been erected by a wealthy
individual, out of gratitude for having, on a certain foggy
night, been preserved from walking into the Severn, in consequence
of hearing St. Andrew's bells suddenly strike out.</p>

<p>It is a curious circumstance that while the vulgar mind has
been at all times prone to attribute extraordinary or unaccountable
results to Satanic influences, and to regard the evil
one as the very essence of craft and cunning, a tendency has
always been apparent to reduce his pretensions as a prudent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
or successful bargain-maker, especially in those instances
wherein he was supposed to have come in contact with ecclesiastical
antagonism, and he is almost invariably shown up
in popular legends as being outwitted and frustrated in his
diabolical designs, not less by expedients of the most simple
kind, than by evasions as transparent as they are dishonest.
We are told by Dr. Adam Clarke that Satan is far from
excelling in knowledge, being more cunning and insidious than
wise and prudent, and that we in general give this fallen spirit
credit for much more wisdom than he possesses; an estimate
of character which cannot be far from correct, if the following
recollections of his doings in Worcestershire may be relied on:
On the north boundary wall of Bromsgrove churchyard lies
an old stone effigy of a man in the attitude of prayer, and it
is said that the original of this figure sold himself to the
wicked one for certain stipulations, one of which was, that
when he died, he should not be buried either in or out of the
churchyard; and the man accordingly gave directions to be
buried under the boundary wall, and the effigy to be placed
above it. This was a similar trick to that of the teetotaller,
who, having taken the pledge not to drink liquors in or out of
his house, compromised the matter to his own conscience by
striding across the threshold and draining a jug to the bottom.</p>

<p>So the people of Bewdley were once saved from destruction
by a drunken cobbler, who foregather'd with the man of
sin, as the latter was travelling with a spadeful of earth to
dam up the Severn, and thereby inundate the country. The
devil had lost his way, and inquired of the cobbler, who,
smelling sulphur, and foreseeing annihilation to all his
customers at Bewdley, coolly assured the father of lies that
the distance to that town was so great that he had worn out a
whole lot of shoes he carried in a bag at his back. Whereupon
the fallen spirit at once dropped the earth, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
remains to this day the hill called "The Devil's Spadeful," or
"Spittleful." A similar legend prevails in many counties,
especially in reference to the Wrekin and High Ercall Hills,
Shropshire, and "Robin Hood's Butts," Herefordshire.</p>

<p>Near Little Shelsley grows a plant called "Devil's-bit"
(<i>Succisa pratensis</i>), which it is said was given to heal any
deadly wounds, but as the devil saw how many wicked persons
were thus rescued from his grasp, he bit the roots off this
plant, whereupon it miraculously grew without them, and
follows up the habit to this day.</p>

<p>In Bretforton church is the legend of "Maid Margaret"
carved on one of the north pillars. It is said that a nun,
being tempted by the devil, resisted, and was devoured by
him, whereupon the holy sister, who always went armed with
a cross, used it with such effect, that the evil one burst
asunder, and she emerged.</p>

<p>Oliver Cromwell's compact with the devil, before the battle
of Worcester, has been a favourite fable probably ever since
the restoration of Charles II. Echard, the rev. historian,
condescends to propagate the fable, that Cromwell, on the
morning that he defeated the king's army, had conference
personally with the devil in Perry Wood, and made a contract
with him, that to have his will then, and in all things else for
seven years from that day (he unsuccessfully proposed twenty-one
or fourteen years), he should, at the expiration of the said
term, have him at his command, to do at his pleasure, both
with his soul and body. A valiant officer called Lindsay,
an intimate friend of Cromwell's, is said to have been so
horror-struck at the interview, that he fled from the battle
that day, escaped to a friend's house at Norfolk, and foretold
Cromwell's death would happen in seven years, which accordingly
so happened on the anniversary day of the battle.</p>

<p>A few remains of fairy lore are yet to be picked up here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
and there, and Mr. Jabez Allies has furnished us with as much
probably as can be gained on this subject. He says that the
peasantry of Alfrick and Lulsley occasionally suppose themselves
"Puck-laden" (<i>i. e.</i> misled by that mischievous sprite
Puck, <i>alias</i> good old <i>cider</i>), and so drawn into ditches and bogs,
whereupon the evil genius sets up a horse-laugh; also that
Rosebury Rock, opposite Knightsford bridge, was a favourite
haunt of the fairies, concerning whom he tells some curious
tales of the patronage they bestowed upon those who had done
them a good turn.</p>

<p>In the same locality is a place called "Callow's Leap,"
where it is said that a mighty hunter, named Callow, leaped
down the precipice; what became of him afterwards no record
saith, but it may be presumed that the consequences of the
leap were not fatal, as Callow's grave, or at least the name
of it, exists near Tenbury, a considerable distance from
Alfrick. Many are the tales of sights unearthly to be seen
at the former spot by night&mdash;of hideous black dogs running
about, and of the difficulty of getting horses by that part of
the road at times.</p>

<p>The "Jovial Hunter" is a legend of some note at Bromsgrove,
and an old ballad is still remembered there which
records the wondrous achievements of "Sir Ryalash" in
ridding that country of an enormous wild boar, which, nerved
by the promise of a fair lady's hand, he succeeded in despatching
after a four hours' conflict. Bromsgrove, it is
said, received its name from Boar's-grove, and there is a
place called Burcot, or Boar's-cot, about three miles to the
east of the town. An old story has also been handed down
that the devil kept his hounds at Halesowen (Hell's Own),
and, with his huntsman, Harry-ca-nab, riding on wild bulls,
used to hunt the boars on Bromsgrove Lickey. Feckenham
forest extended round this neighbourhood for many miles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
and there are some historical evidences left of the zest with
which the sport of hunting was formerly pursued here, among
which is the mandate issued by Edward I to Peter Corbet, an
ancestor of the family at Chaddesley, who, like other hunters
of wolves, was in the king's pay. (See "Rambler," vol. iii,
p. 220.) An argument has been raised from the fact of Robin
Hood's name being applied to some trees and other objects in
this neighbourhood that the great outlaw must have been at
one time a resident in Feckenham forest; but there is no
tangible evidence to support the conjecture, as the name of
Robin Hood, like that of the Duke of Wellington or Lord
Nelson, may probably be met with on signboards or otherwise
in every county in England.</p>

<p>The parish of Wolverley has likewise its legend, derived
from the period of the holy wars. Wolverley Court belonged
to one of the Attwoods, who went out as a Crusader, was
taken by the Saracens, and kept so long in a dungeon, that
his lady at home, supposing him to be dead, was about to
marry again, when the knight, having made a vow to the
Virgin to present a large portion of his lands to the church
at Worcester, was supernaturally liberated from his cell,
whisked through the air, and deposited near home, when of
course he lost no time in forbidding the banns. The
prisoner's fetters are still preserved at the Court, as also the
sculptured figure of the warrior, which formerly lay in the
old church.</p>

<p>The name of Kidderminster is said to have been derived
from the mythological period of Britain's history when King
Cador resided at that town; his Majesty having been the
founder of a minster there&mdash;hence Cador-minster; or, still
more whimsical, comes the following versified legend:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"King Cador saw a pretty maid:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">King Cador would have kissed her:<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The damsel slipt aside and said&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'King Cador, you have miss'd her.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>(And echo answered&mdash;"Cador-mister.")</p>

<p>As to the etymology of the parish of Oddingley, Dr. Nash
informs us that Odd and Dingley, two Saxon giants, were said
to have fought upon the common at that place, till the former,
beginning to feel anxious for his own personal comfort,
roared out&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O Dingley, Dingley, spare my breath:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It shall be called Oddingley heath."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Oddo and Doddo were two powerful dukes of the Mercian
kingdom, whose history is connected with that of several
towns in this district, and they were buried in Pershore
church. Oddingley, however, most probably means "the
field of Oding."</p>

<p>In Areley Kings churchyard is a curious monument formed
of sandstone blocks, like a portion of a wall, being part of
the ancient fence; it bears this inscription in old capitals:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Lithologema quare?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reponitvr Sir Harry."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Sir Harry Coningsby, who is thus commemorated, lived in
a moated grange in Herefordshire, and was early left a
widower, with one child, a daughter, on whom all his happiness
was centred. He was standing one day at an open
window with the child in his arms, when, in some playful
action, she threw herself out of her father's arms, and fell
into the moat beneath, where life soon became extinct. The
wretched parent could no longer bear to reside at that fatal
spot, and removed into Worcestershire, to a house called
"The Sturt," in Areley Kings, where he led a solitary life,
went usually by the name of "Sir Harry," and when he died
was buried in a corner of the churchyard, the epitaph being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
carved on that part of the churchyard wall which formed
Sir Harry's "pane.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>" A walnut tree was planted close to
the grave, and the boys of the parish were to have the
walnuts, and crack them on "Sir Harry's" gravestone; but
the tree was cut down by the late rector.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> The term "pane" means that portion of the churchyard fence which
was allotted to each parishioner to keep in repair.</p></div>

<p>The ancient parish of King's Norton keeps up the memory
of two traditions&mdash;first, that Queen Elizabeth once slept in
a large and picturesque building still shown there; and
second, that some centuries ago, letters were usually directed
to "Birmingham <i>near</i> Kingsnorton." Droitwich likewise
boasts of having, in some remote period, been a town of so
much more importance than Worcester, that the latter was
known chiefly by its vicinity to the former. There is indeed
every probability that the salt springs of Droitwich were
worked by the earliest settlers in this island.</p>

<p>The register of Broughton Hackett is said by Nash to contain
an entry, that in the reign of Queen Anne the minister
of that parish was tried, convicted, and executed, for baking
his shepherd's boy in an oven!</p>

<p>There is a tradition at Birtsmorton that Cardinal Wolsey
was once a servant in the Court-house of that parish.</p>

<p>Tibberton also has its traditions. It is said there that one
Roger Tandy (<i>temp.</i> James I) was so very strong, that being
at Sir John Pakington's, at Westwood, he took up a hogshead
full of beer, drank out of the bunghole, and set it down again,
without resting it on his knee or elsewhere. Also that one
Hugh Pescod, <i>alias</i> "the little Turk," in the time of Oliver
Cromwell, was hung up by the neck for half-an-hour by some
Parliamentarian soldiers, and being cut down and thrown into
a saw-pit, he recovered; in memory of which era in his history
he planted some elm trees near his orchard at Wood Green.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>
<p>At Dudley there is a tradition that many years ago a giant
lived in Dudley castle, as did also one in the castle of Birmingham.
The Birmingham giant had done suit and service
to the Dudley giant for many years, but growing fat he began
to kick, and refused to serve the Dudley giant longer. A
furious dispute thereupon broke out; the Dudley giant in his
rage threw a large stone all the way from Dudley at the Birmingham
giant, and demolished his castle and killed him.
Some of his surviving followers erected a stone in the lane
as a memento of prowess and rage, and called it the war stone,
whence the name Warstone Lane. When the lord of Dudley
castle began the dispute which ended in the ruin of the lord
of Birmingham, the latter had a large and deep hole made
in the castle yard, in the which were buried the treasures
and the muniments of his house, with a full charge to his
familiar spirit&mdash;every great man in those days had one&mdash;to
watch over them until better days came and justice were done
to him. Some years ago, as a gentleman was digging a well
in his garden he came unexpectedly upon a strong box. He
began to dig round it, and had got it slung in ropes for the
purpose of hauling it up, when an ugly dwarf jumped upon
it (no one seeing where he came from or went to), exclaiming,
"That's mine." Immediately all the earth fell in the hole
he had made. He tried many times to get the box, but
every time the same thing occurred, so he gave up the attempt
in despair. My grandmother has often told me she did not
know the gentleman, but she had frequently seen the pick
and spade with which the hole had been made.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Vernal.</span></p>

<p>St. Augustine's Oak&mdash;the celebrated tree under which the
"Apostle of the English" is said to have held a conference
with the British bishops&mdash;has been claimed by many places
in this county as a plant of Worcestershire growth: Rock
and Alfrick, a place called "The Apostle's Oak," near Stan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>ford
Bridge, the Mitre Oak at Hartlebury, and other places,
have been pointed out, but the record left of the site of this
famous oak is so vague that any attempt at fixing it must be
mere matter of conjecture. Some have supposed that the
parish of Rock, whose original name was derived from the
Saxon word signifying an oak, must have been the site, as
Dr. Nash informs us that there was a hollow oak there held
in great veneration by the country people, and called by
them "The Apostle's Oak." When the turnpike was first
erected, it served as a habitation for the keeper, and through
his carelessness was burnt down.</p>

<h2>Old Customs.</h2>


<h3>THE BABES OF BETHLEHEM.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/il-p205i.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">It</span> is an ancient custom at Norton, near Evesham, on
the 28th of December (Innocents' Day) to ring a
muffled peal, in token of sorrow for the slaughter of
the hapless "babes of Bethlehem," and, immediately afterwards,
an unmuffled peal, in manifestation of joy for the
deliverance and escape of the infant Saviour.</p>


<h3>RINGING FOR THE PARSON.</h3>

<p>At Huddington church a custom prevails not to ring the
bell for service till the clergyman appears in sight&mdash;which
probably originated in that interesting period of church discipline
when congregations were not always sure of a parson
till they had caught him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>


<h3>BAPTISMS.</h3>

<p>The number of godfathers and godmothers to attend at
baptisms was fixed at Worcester, at a synod held in 1240,
when the same provision was made as is now required by our
rubric, viz., "That there should be for every male child that
is to be baptized two godfathers and one godmother, and for
every female one godfather and two godmothers."</p>


<h3>CRABBING THE PARSON.</h3>

<p>The custom of "crabbing the parson" was observed till
lately at St. Kenelm's chapelry, near Stourbridge. It was
the practice for the villagers, and all who chose, to arm
themselves with crabs on the wake Sunday, and as the
parson approached the church they were plentifully and
vigorously discharged at him in the most approved mode of
"horizontal firing" until he reached the haven of the church
porch. The substitution of sticks and stones for crabs led
to the suppression of the practice. It is said that the origin
of this curious game was at some "time immemorial," when
a certain clergyman who served this chapel abstracted some
dumplings from a pot at a farmhouse near and deposited
them in the sleeves of his surplice, from which they rolled
out during service time on the head of the clerk, who,
thinking himself insulted, retaliated upon the parson by
pelting him with a quantity of crabs which he had accidentally
got in his pocket.</p>


<h3>PRIMITIVE CATHEDRAL CUSTOMS.</h3>

<p>Two ancient customs are observed at Worcester Cathedral&mdash;first,
the separation of men from the women; and second,
the division of the morning service into two. The allotment
to each sex of a distinct place in the church was very strictly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
observed among the primitive Christians, and Geoffrey of
Monmouth states that the Britons observed the ancient
custom of Troy, by which the men and women used to
celebrate their festivals apart. There is an old <i>jeu d'esprit</i>
in relation to the custom at Worcester:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The churches in general, we everywhere find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are places where men to the women are joined;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Worcester, it seems, they are more cruel hearted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For men and their wives are brought here to be parted."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As to the division of the morning service (one portion being
performed between eight and nine o'clock; and the Litany,
Communion, and sermon, from eleven to one), it is to be
observed that these services were originally intended to be
distinct, so that the curate might have time between them
to receive the names of those who intended to communicate.
The Communion Office still everywhere retains the old name
of "the second service;" and Bishop Overal imputes it to
the negligence of ministers and the carelessness of the people
that they are huddled together into one office. (See Wheatley
on the Common Prayer.)</p>


<h3>MARRIAGE CUSTOM.</h3>

<p>The neighbourhood of Abberton, Flyford Flavel, Wick,
Naunton Beauchamp, and other rural parishes in that district,
celebrate weddings by serenading the house of the newly-married
pair at night, and firing off guns, pistols, or any
other instrument which will explode. Some parties at Wick
were not long ago summoned before the magistrates for
having participated in one of these popping-bouts, but the
indignation of the district was greatly aroused by their being
mulcted in certain expenses and ordered to discontinue the
practice, for it is believed to be nearly "as old as Adam,"
and as indispensable a ceremony as the marriage vow itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>


<h3>FUNEREAL.</h3>

<p>At Broadwas, at all funerals, the bearers invariably set
down the coffin in the middle of the lane leading to the
church, and forming a circle around it, they all bow most
reverentially&mdash;a remnant, no doubt, of those ceremonies
observed in Catholic days, to mark respect for the departed
and to bid him farewell.</p>


<h3>ASCENSION DAY.</h3>

<p>Brand, in his "Popular Antiquities," states that a servant,
named Betty Jelkes, who lived several years at Evesham,
informed him of an ancient custom at that place for the
master-gardeners to give their workpeople a treat of baked
peas, both white and grey, and pork, annually on Holy
Thursday.</p>

<p>On Ascension Day the inhabitants of Nantwich formerly
assembled and sang a hymn of thanksgiving for the blessings
of brine, and a very ancient pit there was held in great
veneration and bedecked with boughs, flowers, and garlands;
a jovial band of young people encircled the place, celebrating
the occasion with song and dance. The custom also was yearly
observed at Droitwich, on St. Richard's Day. This "Saint
Richard" was Richard de Burford, Bishop of Chichester,
who was born at Droitwich about the year 1200. Leland
says that the principal salt springs "did fayle in the tyme
of Richard de la Wich, or Burford, Bishop of Chichester;
and that after, by his intercession, it was restored to the
profit of the ould course; such (he adds) is the superstition of
the people. In token whereof, or for the honour that the
Wichemen and saulters bear unto this Richard, their countrieman,
they used of late tymes on his daye to hange about the
sault springe or well, once a yeere, with tapestrie, and to
have drinking games or revels at it." One year "in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
Presbyterian time (as Aubrey hath it) it was discontinued,
and after that the spring shrank up or dried up for some time;
so afterwards they revived their annual custom, notwithstanding
the power of Parliament and the soldiers, and the
salt water returned again and still continues."</p>


<h3>GUY FAULX.</h3>

<p>The 5th of November&mdash;so long celebrated as</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The day that God did prevent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To blow up his king and parliament,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&mdash;is still faintly remembered among us by means of squibs
and crackers stealthily discharged by mischievous boys in
the streets. The good old system of bonfires&mdash;always a
most popular mode of rejoicing&mdash;would probably not have
been abandoned but for the numerous conflagrations it must
have occasioned at a time when thatch generally covered our
houses. In 1789, the Worcester corporation caused the bellman
to cry down bonfires, although previous to that time the
expense of providing fuel, and drink to hand round to the
happy spectators, had been regularly defrayed out of the
civic purse. Last year (1855) the notoriety of the day was
partly revived, though on another account&mdash;namely, its being
the first anniversary of the battle of Inkermann.</p>


<h3>"ROYAL OAK DAY"&mdash;MAY 29,</h3>

<p>is wonderfully shorn of its honours since people have
generally taken to read history, and have learned how little
reason they have to bless the memory of the Stuarts. The
marvellous escape of Charles II, when his pursuers passed
under the oak tree in which he was secreted after the
battle of Worcester, is now only commemorated in the city
which boasts of being "faithful" to its kings whether their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
memory be odorous or not, by some half-dozen boughs of oak
being affixed over as many doorways in different streets.</p>


<h3>MOTHERING SUNDAY.</h3>

<p>Midlent, or, as it is called in Worcestershire, "Mothering
Sunday," is still observed as a minor festival, upon which all
the children and grand-children visit their parents, and the
pride of the feast is invariably a loin of veal.</p>


<h3>ALL FOOLS' DAY.</h3>

<p>The first of April, too, is not forgotten by the young fry, as
"April fool day;" when all sorts of traps are set to make
each other look ridiculous.</p>


<h3>PLEDGING.</h3>

<p>The old custom of drinking healths is on the decline. In a
book of rhymes, published about 1660, in "a catch made
before the king's coming to Worcester with the Scottish
army," is the following:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Each man upon his back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall swallow his sack,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This health will endure no shrinking;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rest shall dance round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him that lies on the ground:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Fore me this is excellent drinking."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<h3>MAY-POLES.</h3>

<p>The May-pole, it has been already stated, is still in
existence at Offenham, Hartlebury, Bayton, &amp;c. Thomas
Hall, a puritanical writer (1660), author of the "Downfall
of May Games," says&mdash;"The most of these May-poles are
stollen, yet they give out that the poles are given them.
There were two May-poles set up in my parish (Kingsnorton);<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
the one was stollen, and the other was given by a profest
Papist. That which was stollen was said to bee given, when
'twas proved to their faces that 'twas stollen, and they were
made to acknowledge their offence. This pole that was stolen
was rated at five shillings: if all the poles, one with another,
were so rated, which was stollen this May, what a considerable
sum would it amount to! Fightings and bloodshed are usual
at such meetings, insomuch that 'tis a common saying, that
'tis no festival unless there bee some fightings."</p>


<h3>HEAVING.</h3>

<p>"Heaving" or "lifting" at Easter has not long been discontinued
at Worcester, the locality where the writer last
heard of its performance being in Birdport and Dolday. On
Easter Monday the women would surround any man who
happened to be passing by, and by their joint efforts lift him
up in the air, and on the next day the men did the same to
the women. The only mode of escaping this kind of elevation
was by "forking out" (as they term it in the classical
phraseology of that neighbourhood) a certain sum to be
spent in drink. At Hartlebury, a few years back, the farmhouse
mistress would give the male servant a treat on Easter
Tuesday, to heave the female servant, for she superstitiously
believed that it would prevent the female servant from
breaking the crocks during the ensuing year. At Kidderminster,
on Easter Monday, the women would deck themselves
gaily for the occasion, dress a chair with ribbons, and place
a rope across the street to prevent the escape of any unfortunate
man who chanced to pass that way. He was then
seized, placed in the chair, elevated up on high, turned round
three times, set down again, and was then kissed by all the
women. He was also expected to pay something towards
the evening's entertainments of tea and dancing. Next day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
the women were heaved by the men. This custom was
observed in the streets till about a dozen years ago, and
even to a later period in the factories and public-houses in
Kidderminster. Heaving was no doubt originally designed
to represent the resurrection.</p>


<h3>VALENTINE'S DAY</h3>

<p>is one of the best preserved customs of the middle ages, and
will probably last as long as "young men and maidens"
have a tender regard for each other. The first woman seen
by a man on the morning of this day, or <i>vice versa</i>, is called
their Valentine, though the parties never see each other
again. Since the establishment of the penny postage system
and the cheapening of paper and print, the custom of sending
Valentines has been much on the increase, some of our
Worcester booksellers having found the trade sufficiently
important to warrant the insertion of advertisements in the
newspapers announcing a varied stock of these little missives
on hand; while the progress of education and taste among
the people is shown by the elegance with which some of the
amatory designs are "got up." There is no satisfactory
account of the origin of this custom, which has been proved to
have existed at least five centuries ago. In the life of St.
Valentine there is nothing that could have given rise to it.
There was a rural tradition that on this day every bird chose
its mate:</p>

<h3>MORRIS DANCING</h3>

<p>is still resorted to by the boatmen of the Severn and the
canals, whenever the frost interrupts their ordinary occupation,
on which occasion small parties of them, dressed up
fantastically with ribbons, and carrying short sticks, which
they strike together in time with parts of the dance, perform
in the streets, soliciting alms. The Morris Dancers made a
considerable figure in the parochial festivals of the olden
times. It is said the custom was introduced by the Moors
into Spain. A few years ago a dance was performed in
Herefordshire by eight men whose united ages amounted to
eight hundred years; and Sir William Temple mentions that
in a certain year of King James's reign there were ten men
in Herefordshire who went about that county as Morris
Dancers whose ages altogether numbered twelve hundred
years! 'Tis not so much (says he) that so many in one
county should live to that age, as that they should be in
vigour and humour to travel and dance.</p>


<h3>THE "WAITS"</h3>

<p>linger yet among us, but their operations are confined to an
early serenading of the citizens with soft music a few
mornings in the Christmas time. Formerly the Worcester
Corporation kept a "company of waites," paying them wages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
and dressing them in livery (cock'd hats and blue coats or
cloaks), to be ready to play on all public occasions; but towards
the close of the last century they were gradually superseded
by another order of minstrels, "ye drums and fifes." Busby,
in his Dictionary of Music, says the term "wayghts or waites"
formerly signified "hautboys," and, what is remarkable, has
no singular number. From the instruments, its signification
was for a time transferred to the performers themselves;
who, being in the habit of parading the streets by night with
their music, occasioned the name to be applied generally to
all musicians who followed a similar practice; hence those
persons who annually, at the approach of Christmas, salute
us with their nocturnal concerts, were, and are to this day,
called Wayghts.</p>


<h3>THE CURFEW BELL</h3>

<p>still is occasionally rung at St. Helen's church, in this city,
and at Bewdley and King's Norton, also at Pershore from
October till March. At Evesham it is rung in the fine old
bell-tower at eight o'clock every evening, except on Saturdays,
when it is rung at seven o'clock during the Christmas holidays&mdash;the
week before and the week after Christmas Day it is
rung at seven o'clock; and probably at other old towns in
the county which I have not ascertained; but the perpetuation
of the old custom seems to be dependent solely on the poor
ringers' respect for ancient usages, as they apparently get
no money for their pains. At St. Helen's, after ringing the
eight o'clock bell, it was usual to strike upon it the number
of the day of the month.</p>


<h3>PLUM-PUDDING AND OTHER BELLS.</h3>

<p>At St. Martin's church, a few weeks before Christmas, a
bell is nightly rung, the expense of which, I believe, is pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>vided
for under the will of one Sir Robert Berkeley, Knight,
who left a fund for bell-ringing on certain days, and to purchase
bell-ropes. The bell at St. Martin's is called "the
plum-pudding bell," probably in allusion to the approaching
Christmas festivities, as the "pancake bell" was formerly
rung in many places at Easter. In most old towns, as at
Worcester and Bewdley, a very early morning bell was
formerly rung, probably for the purpose of waking up apprentices
and arousing the working classes generally, as also
school-boys to their studies; but these parties are now
mainly left to manage their early rising as they can, unless
some friendly factory bell be at hand. There was also a
passing bell, tolled while persons were dying. In the articles
of visitation for the diocese of Worcester in 1662 occurs the
following: "Doth the parish clerk or sexton take care to
admonish the living, by tolling of a passing bell, of any that
are dying, thereby to meditate of their own deaths, and to
commend the other's weak condition to the mercy of God?"</p>


<h3>ST. CATHARINE'S DAY.</h3>

<p>"Catherning," or "Cattaring,"&mdash;that is, the observance of
St. Catharine's Day (Nov. 25) has not yet gone out of remembrance
in Worcestershire. It was formerly the custom of
the Dean and Chapter&mdash;that day being the last of their audit&mdash;to
distribute amongst the inhabitants of the College precincts
a rich compound of wine, spices, &amp;c., called "the
Cattern bowl." A modified edition of the custom, I believe,
is still observed. At Leigh, Harvington, Offenham, and other
parishes, the young people had a custom of going round to
the houses and asking for apples and beer, using a doggrel
rhyme on the occasion which differs in most places, and St.
Thomas's and old Christmas Day are sometimes selected for
the purpose. The St. Thomas's Day perambulation is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
some places called "Going a gooding." The rhyme or carol
more usually sung on St. Catharine's Day began thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Catt'n and Clement comes year by year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some of yr apples and some of yr beer;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some for Peter, some for Paul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some for Him who made us all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peter was a good old man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For his sake give us some:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some of the best and none of the worst,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And God will send yr souls to roost."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Concluding thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Up the ladder and down with the can,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give me red apples and I'll begone."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The ladder alluding to the store of apples, generally kept in
a loft; and the can, doubtless, to the same going down into
the cellar for the beer. In some districts of the county the
following doggrel is repeated:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"St. Clements! St. Clements! A cat by the ear!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A good red apple&mdash;a pint o' beer!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some o' your mutton, some o' your <i>vale</i>! [veal]<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If it's good, gie us a <i>dale</i>, [deal]<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If its <i>naught</i>, gie us some <i>saut</i>! [salt]<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Butler, butler, fill the bowl&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you fill it of the best,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God will send your soul to rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if you fill it of the small,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Devil take butler, bowl, and all!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A correspondent states that this custom originated, or was
revived, when Queen Elizabeth visited Worcester, the inhabitants
sparing no expense to give her Majesty a gracious
reception upon St. Catharine's Day, when a number of apples
were strung before the fire and the citizens went with a can
from house to house, begging apples and beer, and repeating
the above lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>


<h3>CURIOUS CHARITY, &amp;c.</h3>

<p>At Kidderminster is a whimsical charity for the benefit of
the inhabitants of Church Street. Mr. Brecknall, a bachelor,
in 1778, bequeathed a farthing loaf and twopenny cake annually
to every <i>single</i> person born in that street who should apply
for it on the 21st of June; the applicant is eligible during the
whole of his or her life, or in whatever part of the world
residing. The mere residents of Church Street, if not born
there, are also entitled to a cake, but their claim is forfeited
when they leave the street. The recipients make themselves
truly "jolly" on the night of the distribution.&mdash;In the same
town the inhabitants formerly assembled at a particular hour
on Michaelmas Day, on the occasion of the election of a
bailiff, which was announced by the ringing of the town-house
bell, and during one hour&mdash;termed "lawless hour"&mdash;the
poorer classes amused themselves by throwing cabbage-stalks
at each other, while the higher classes threw apples.
Sometimes the apples were thrown from windows, to be
scuffled for, and many a black eye was the consequence of
this fruit being used as a projectile. After a whole street had
been amused by this practical fun, it was given out by some
leader of the mob what locality was next to be favoured, and
thither they all proceeded at once. This custom was observed
within the last twenty years.</p>


<h3>THE WHOOP.</h3>

<p>On the second Sunday in July there was a custom at
Chaddesley Corbett to put strangers "through the whoop."
I cannot ascertain exactly what this practice was, as the
inhabitants from whom I have sought information fight
exceedingly shy of it, and some even deny the existence of
the custom; but one gentleman informs me that it was usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
on that day for the lower order of the parishioners to play
some practical joke&mdash;anything which first presented itself
to their imaginations&mdash;upon whatever stranger happened to
come within their boundary.</p>


<h3>TENURE.</h3>

<p>There is a curious tenure at Inkberrow. The manor and
advowson were granted by Philip and Mary to an ancestor
of the present Lord Abergavenny, on condition that in default
of male issue the same should revert to the Crown. Up to
the present time, however, there has been no lack of males
in the family, and the present noble lord "hath his quiver
full" of promising sons.</p>


<h3>NICKNAMES.</h3>

<p>Among the colliers in the north of this county, as also that
singular race of beings known as the "Lye-wasters," near
Stourbridge, the custom is observed of adopting nicknames,
so that they are but very little known by their Christian or
surnames, and an officer who goes to serve a writ or summons
has a task which he finds himself unable to perform.
Amusing instances are given in "The Rambler," vol. ii, p.
80, and vol. iii, p. 253.</p>


<h3>BRIDE ALES.</h3>

<p>At Halesowen, in former times, the celebration of bride-ales
or love-ales, at a wedding, prevailed, and led to such disorder
that during the reign of Elizabeth it was found necessary by
the Borough Court to make some most stringent orders
thereon. The custom was for the bride to sell a quantity of
ale, for which she received, by way of contribution, whatever
handsome price the friends assembled chose to pay; the
object being to assist the young people in commencing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
housekeeping. The custom is now reversed, for the entertainment
to be given by young married people to their friends
is at present a serious item.</p>


<h3>PAUPER RELIEF.</h3>

<p>The way of relieving parochial paupers at Harvington in
the seventeenth century was by assigning them for certain
days to any of the inhabitants who would employ them.
An entry occurs in the parish register thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"April 6, 1697. A particular of the several days as Thomas
Godfrey is to worke with the persons under written, for which they
are to give him 8d. a day, or if they doe not employ him, 4d. per
day; to begin from the 6th of April, 1697, and soe to goe thro' the
towne as thus:"</p></div>

<p>Then follows a list of thirty-six persons who were to employ
the said Thomas Godfrey, giving him a month's intermission
at harvest time.</p>


<h3>CHRISTMAS CUSTOMS.</h3>

<p>On the confines of Worcestershire, towards Ledbury, it was
some years ago the custom, on Twelfth Night, for the farmers
to make twelve fires upon the head (east side) of one of their
wheat fields. One of these fires was larger than the others,
which they called "Old Meg," and around this the farm
servants, with their families and friends, congregated to drink
warm cider, with plum-cake toasted in it, and with loud
hurrahs wishing success to the master and his crops; then
they proceeded to the cow-house, which had been nicely
cleaned for the occasion, and the cows had also been cleaned
and tied up, being allowed a good supply of their best provender.
A large plum-cake, bound round with tape, was
stuck on the horns of the best cow, and buckets of cider with
plum-cake were carried in. Each person present then drank
to the health of the cow, using this doggrel:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here's to thee, Ball, and to thy white horn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pray God send thy master a good crop of corn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wheat, rye, and barley, and all sorts of grain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at this time twelve months we meet here again.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">The leaves they are green,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">The nuts they are brown,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">They all hang so high<br /></span>
<span class="i8">That they cannot come down.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They cannot come down until the next year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So thee eat thy oats and we'll drink our beer" (or cider, as the case might be.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then the cowman went up to the cow, and caused her by
some movement to shake her head, and if the cake tumbled
over in front of her it belonged to the cowman; if it fell
behind, it became the property of the dairymaid. The party
then retired to the house, and made the evening jolly, never
concluding the festivity without a dance. I have heard that
to this day the custom of lighting twelve fires on the same
night still prevails at Preston, near Ledbury, and other places.
A correspondent informs me that he remembers a custom
similar to the above being observed in the neighbourhood of
Tenbury on Christmas Eve, and that Neen Sollars was the
last parish in which he witnessed it.</p>

<p>The twelve fires on the eve of Twelfth Day, kindled with
great rejoicing before a pole wrapped up in straw, called
"the old woman," in a field that has been sown with grain,
are supposed to be the remains of some heathen ceremony
derived from the Romans or Saxons, allusive to Ceres and
the months, but afterwards adopted to a holiday season of
the Christian year. This practice (as the Rev. J. Webb,
of Tretire, near Ross, informs us) is still continued in parts
of Herefordshire.</p>

<p>It is the custom at the present day in some parishes in
Worcestershire (Longdon for instance) for boys and girls to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
go early on New Year's morning to all the farmhouses and
say as follows, all in one breath:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Bud well, bear well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God send you fare well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Every sprig and every spray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bushel of apples next New Year's Day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Morning, master and mistress,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A happy New Year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pocket full of money,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A cellar full of beer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Please to give me a New Year's gift."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A clergyman in Worcestershire communicated to the editor
of "Brand's Antiquities" the following doggrel lines, but
the occasion and use of them appear to be unknown, and
it is not unlikely that some corruption has crept into them:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Wassail brews good ale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good ale for Wassail;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wassail comes too soon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the wane of the moon."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the neighbourhood towards Ledbury it was customary
for the farmers to complete wheat-sowing by what was called
Allontide (Allhallows)&mdash;Nov. 1st. If they had finished by
the previous night, a cake was divided between the dairymaid
and the waggoner. If the latter could succeed in going into
the kitchen by a certain hour at night, and cracking his whip
three times, the cake belonged to him; but if the dairymaid,
by any means in her power, could prevent the performance
of the whip ceremony, she claimed one half of the
cake. The maid was on the look-out an hour or so before
the required time, and the wits of both parties were on the
alert to counteract each other's movements, affording much
amusement to the rustic spectators. Respecting the period
for the completion of wheat-sowing, the following old saying
prevailed in the above district many years ago:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"At Michaelmas fair (Oct. 2)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wheat should hide a hare."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Everybody knows that in the present day they do not begin
sowing till after that date.</p>

<p>Old Christmas is still observed, especially in the western
parts of the county. In old-fashioned farmhouses the
misletoe remains till the following Christmas Eve, when it
is burned, and a fresh bough put up.</p>


<h3>HOP-CRIBBING,</h3>

<p>though nearly banished by the advance of education and
improved manners, is occasionally performed in the secluded
parts of this district. The usage is, that when a male
stranger has to pass through the hop ground, he is seized by
the women of the picking party, and threatened to be pitched
into the crib (an article like a large cradle or child's crib,
into which the hops are picked), and then to be smothered
with the caresses of all the oldest and most snuffy women
present, unless he will "shell out" something handsome to
be spent in liquor. If he be young and cleanly, the chances
are ten to one that he prefers paying the fine. Sometimes
respectable women have been cribbed; but in all instances
that have been brought before the magistrates, the law's
supremacy over absurd custom has been vindicated.</p>


<h3>BEATING THE BOUNDS.</h3>

<p>Under the head of "Holy Thursday and its old customs
at Worcester" the "Worcester Herald" of May 27, 1854,
contained the following sketch, which is worthy of a place
here:</p>

<p>The ancient custom of "processioning," or "beating the
bounds," on Ascension Day, it seems, has not yet become
a dead letter in this city. The parishes of All Saints and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
St. Clement are among the most determined upholders of
antiquity in this respect; and although it is but seldom that
either parish rejoices in these "free-and-easy" carnivals,
there are, nevertheless, a few jovial spirits left in each, who
occasionally become so overcharged with a desire for practical
fun and adventure that "go it they must," and straightway
the venerable custom of "beating the bounds" is as good
an excuse as any other for indulging their appetite. The
practice, we believe, has not been observed in the parish of
All Saints for ten years past, till Thursday last, when it
came off with all that <i>eclat</i> and superabundance of relish
which had been accumulating during the interval of a decade
of years. The steeple being, of course, the rallying point,
the party met in the morning at the vestry-room, from
whence sallied the Rev. Dr. Bartlett, the curate, Messrs.
H. Davis and E. Clarke, churchwardens, Messrs. Hill and
William Hole, overseers, and a party of about twenty parishioners,
accompanied by a shoal of larkish striplings&mdash;a body
which considerably augmented during the line of route&mdash;<i>vires
acquirit eundo</i>. Down Quay Street they went and down
the steps towards a boat, but not without misgivings did the
party cast their eyes aloft to the rough-and-ready customers
assembled on the bridge, under the centre arch of which the
"processioners" were doomed to go. Two policemen had
been impressed into the boat for purposes of defence, but
what is a policeman more than any other mortal under the
combined influences of a cataract of mud and water? And
what avails a staff, sword, or dagger, when the enemy grins
upon you from a perpendicular height of some twenty or
thirty feet? Accordingly the party went through the ordeal
with all the calm courage of victims whose only consolation
is, that when custom sanctions, neither law nor personal
comfort is accounted as of the slightest consequence. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
the whole they escaped as well as could have been expected,
having encountered only a little water, mud, and a few et
ceteras. Thence they proceeded, and cast anchor in Dolday
Bay, and after landing there, our informant assures us, "the
game was tremendous." Six or seven shillings' worth of
buns were scattered, about to produce some scrambling among
the boys, and the consequences, as might be supposed, were
a considerable exhibition of juvenile activity, amid which dirt
and rubbish "around their heads were flying;" and one
venerable dame, declaring she had nothing else to part with,
discharged the contents of her teapot so effectually as to
plaster up the eye of our informant, who insists upon it that
he <i>couldn't see</i> why the old lady should have resorted to such
extremities for putting him into hot water. Dolday and
the Butts were passed, and the interior of eight or ten houses
inspected, the wall of the Independent Chapel, Angel Street,
scaled, and the Crown yard reached, when another drenching
shower slightly damped the ardour of the borderers; but,
like Cromwell's Invincibles, armed to the teeth with pluck,
on they went, through Mr. Loxley's house and back premises,
down Powick Lane, through Tanner's yard, and so back to the
vestry, where progress was duly recorded in the books. We
should not omit to state that the chaplain, who accompanied
the party, had done his best to turn the old ceremony to good
account, by delivering appropriate addresses, &amp;c., at various
points on the line of route. On again emerging from the
vestry, a final salutation was given to the explorers by the
assembled crowd, in which the policemen got thoroughly
rinsed; a worthy Boniface, known as "The old fellow," was
prostrated to the ground, in which position he shouted most
piteously, "Blow me if I ain't blinded;" and an overseer was
so roughly handled, that his usual amiable temper became
ruffled, and he swore a deadly oath, that if they gave him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
three months for it, he would punch the head of the first
fellow he caught. The boys were treated to a scrambling for
pence, and so ended the out-door performances. After the
fatigues of the day, a jolly party of about twenty-five sat down
to dinner at Mr. Hill's, the Herefordshire House, Newport
Street, whose admirable catering soon made them forget the
mishaps of the morning, and a very pleasant evening was spent.</p>

<p>The St. Clement's officials (Mr. Bozward, churchwarden,
Messrs. Spilsbury and Fenn, overseers) and a number of
the parishioners, armed with a flag and a bough of oak, took
to the water like ducks, from Tearne's meadow, near the
Dog and Duck, passed down the middle of the Severn to
the Watermen's Chapel, where they landed to take in a part
of the Cattle Market and the site of the old parish church;
embarked once more, passed the Rubicon of the centre arch
of the bridge, landed on the west side of the river, opposite
the Cathedral, and performed all the remainder by land.
The usual ablutions, bedaubings, scramblings, and so forth,
were not forgotten. Afterwards the party dined at the very
comfortable hostelry of the Dog and Duck.</p>

<p>A word or two on the origin of the above old ceremony
may not be misplaced here. We find that formerly it was
the custom to go round the bounds and limits of the parish
on one of the three days before Holy Thursday, or the feast
of Ascension, when the minister, accompanied by the churchwardens
and parishioners, was wont to deprecate the vengeance
of God, beg a blessing on the fruits of the earth, and to
preserve the rights and properties of the parish. To this
Wither alludes in his "Emblems" (1636), as follows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"That every man might keep his own possessions,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our fathers us'd, in reverend processions,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With zealous prayers and praiseful cheere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To walke their parish limits once a yeare;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And well-known markes (which sacrilegious hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now cut or breake) so border'd out their lands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That every one distinctly knew his owne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many brawles, now rife, were then unknowne."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These <i>gang days</i>, as they were called, not only brought to
the recollection of Englishmen the settlement of the Christian
faith on the soil, but they also impressed on the memory
correct notions concerning the origin and nature of proprietorship
in land. These religious processions marked out the
limits of certain portions of land, under which the whole
kingdom was contained; and in all this the principle of
"God's fee" was recognised by the law and the people.
The walking of the parish bounds in religious processions
very materially contributed to form and keep fresh in the
minds of each passing generation the terms on which property
was held, and some of the duties belonging to the
holding. There was a short service ordered to be read
occasionally, composed of such sentences as the following:
"Cursed is he that translateth the bounds and doles of his
neighbour," &amp;c. The custom of processioning (like the large
majority of Christian ceremonies) was no doubt derived from the
heathens, being an imitation of the feast called "Terminalia,"
which was dedicated to the God Terminus, whom they considered
the guardian of fields and landmarks and the keeper
up of friendship and peace among men. The primitive custom
used by the Christians on this occasion was for the people
to accompany the Bishop or some of the clergy into the fields,
where Litanies were chanted and the mercy of God implored,
that He would avert the evils of plague and pestilence, that
He would send them good and favourable weather, and give
them in due season the fruits of the earth. The boundaries
in some places were marked by what they called "Gospel
trees," from the custom of having the Scriptures read under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
or near them by the attendant clergyman. One of these
trees was till lately standing at Stratford-upon-Avon. A
vivid recollection of the exact extent of each parish was kept
alive in the breasts of the juveniles by many kinds of practical
jokes.</p>

<p>When religious processions were abandoned at the time
of the Reformation these parochial processions also generally
fell into disuse, although it was then ordered that they should
be continued, but a principal cause of their discontinuance
of late years was the passing of the Parochial Assessment
Act in 1836, which gave power to Boards of Guardians to
cause the various parishes under their jurisdiction to be
properly mapped and valued. Where this was complied
with, the existence of the new maps rendered it less necessary
that a minute personal recollection of the boundaries of the
parish should be impressed on the minds of the youthful
generation by means of processions. The Worcester Board
of Guardians have not availed themselves of the power conferred
by this Act, for under the Parochial Assessment Act
not a single parish of this city has hitherto been mapped
and valued, until now that All Saints' is under contract for
that purpose. The Guardians have not felt it necessary to
do so, as no churchwardens or overseers have yet (1855) called
upon them to exercise their powers; and it seems that the
concurrence of the latter officers is necessary for the ordering
of maps and valuations. Processioning, however, is still
recognised by the law, for by an act passed so recently as
1844 (7th and 8th Victoria, chap. 101) power is given to
charge for all necessary expenses properly incurred in perambulations
and in setting up and keeping in repair the boundary
stones of the parish, provided that such perambulation do not
arise more than once in three years.</p>

<h3>HOPS.</h3>

<p>Were hops cultivated in East Worcestershire? In many
places in Beoley parish, hops are found growing in the hedgerows,
and there is a large field there which is called "The
Hop-garden." The year 1855 is believed to have produced
a larger crop of hops than has ever been known (duty
&pound;398,635. 6s. 5-3/4d.). In 1801 the Worcester district paid a
larger duty than had been on previous record, though far
below the duty of 1855; and in 1826 the duty was higher
than in 1801, being &pound;269,331; or &pound;129,304 less than in 1855.
Can any one tell, by document or otherwise, what was the
hop acreage in this district in the year 1801?</p>

<p>When was the practice of planting groves, or avenues of

of ancestral dignity than these solemn avenues of trees&mdash;for
instance, those of Spetchley, Cotheridge, &amp;c. In Rome, no
great house was formerly built without an avenue of trees,
and Plato taught his scholars to love the groves of Academus
almost as well as his philosophy.</p>


<h3>CROMWELL PILLORIED.</h3>

<p>On the key-stone of the arch of the Guildhall entrance-door
is the figure of a man's head, having the expression of pain,
and with his ears nailed back. Is there any ground for supposing
that this was intended to represent Oliver Cromwell
in the pillory, while the two Charleses stand in regal state
on each side? I have heard the fag-end of an old song, of
which the following is the burden:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The Worcester people being hurt full sore, sir,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nail'd Cromwell's head by the ears above the Town-hall door, sir.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3"><i>Chorus</i>. Heigho, what will they do?<br /></span>
<span class="i3">They're always finding something new."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is, however, probable that the sculpture in question is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
intended, with the other heads and figures adorning the Hall,
merely to represent some abstract idea, such as Justice,
Punishment, Pain, &amp;c.</p>


<h3>THE PILLORY, &amp;c.</h3>

<p>When were the last known instances of bull-baiting and
cock-fighting in Worcester, and when was the pillory last
used? About forty years ago the present Lord Dundonald
(then Lord Cochrane) was sentenced by Lord Ellenborough
"to stand in and upon the pillory for the space of one hour."
The public and the press were justly indignant at a distinguished
and enterprising naval officer being sentenced to
such an infamous punishment, and it was not carried into
effect; the Legislature took up the matter, and in their zeal
abolished the punishment of the pillory altogether.</p>


<h3>THE MILWARD EVIDENCES.</h3>

<p>Can you, sir, or any of your correspondents, inform me of
the whereabout of the "<i>Milward Evidences</i>," which were
used by Shaw and Nash in their histories of the counties of
Worcester and Stafford. The heiress of the Milwards,
of Wollescott, married Hungerford Oliver, Esq., whose
descendants, till about fifteen or twenty years ago, resided
at the family seat of Wollescott (which had been in the
possession of the Milwards before the reign of Elizabeth),
and since then they have gone down in the world, and probably
these valuable Manuscripts are destroyed.&mdash;C. J. D.</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;The Milward family possessed good landed possessions
and resided at Wollescote (called Ousecote in Nash)
in the reign of Henry VIII. The last of the family bearing
the name was Thomas Milward, Esq., who died in 1784. By
his wife, Prudence, daughter of Captain Oliver Dixon, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
Dixon's Green, Dudley, he had four daughters, viz., Elizabeth
and Ann Milward, who died unmarried; Prudence, the wife
of Mr. Hungerford Oliver, who had issue&mdash;the late Edward
Oliver, Esq., of Wollescote, and others; and Mary, the wife
of John Foster, of Leicester Grange, county Warwick, Esq.
(Sheriff of Worcestershire, 18th George III), who had issue
one child, John Foster, of the Middle Temple, who died
unmarried. Mr. Edward Oliver succeeded to the property
of his grandfather and the papers referred to by your correspondent.
Being afterwards in embarrassed circumstances,
he left Wollescote and resided in a distant part of the
kingdom for several years. The papers, in sacks, were left
at tenants' cottages, and by removal, damp, and other causes,
became gradually lessened, until about twenty years ago,
after Mr. Oliver's return to Wollescote, when he was induced
by a relative, Mr, J. H. Dixon, of Oldswinford, to look over
the papers with him, and they retained such as possessed
any topographical or family interest, made extracts from
some, and destroyed the rest. Mr. Dixon, who has made
topographical collections relative to Stourbridge, Dudley, and
some other neighbouring places, possesses, I believe, the few
Milward papers remaining.</p>


<h3>CAST-IRON GRAVE SLABS.</h3>

<p>A cast-iron slab may be seen on a grave in Himbleton
church, having an inscription to Philip Fincher and his wife,
who died, the former in 1660 and the latter in 1690. Is
any earlier instance known of the use of cast-iron for such a
purpose?&mdash;<i>Answer.</i> In Mr. Lowe's paper in the Sussex collections
is a description of a cast-iron grave slab of the fourteenth
century, existing in Burwash church. It has an ornamental
cross, and inscription in relief, and is considered as unique
for the style and period, being probably the oldest existing
article of the kind produced by our foundries.</p>

<h3>STEWPONEY.</h3>

<p>Can any one supply a more probable origin of the odd
name of the "Stewponey" inn, near Stourbridge, than the
following: In ancient times there was probably a bridge
over the Stour near Stourton Castle, and an inn would be
necessary for the traffic passing over the bridge. This hostelry
would be described in the Latin documents of the day
as that by Stourbridge (<i>Stour ponte</i>), easily corrupted into
"Stour pone" and "Stewponey." Or the word may be a
corruption of the French <i>Pont</i> and the word <i>Stour</i>.</p>


<h3>QUEEN ELIZABETH AT HARTLEBURY.</h3>

<p>Is any inhabitant of Hartlebury enabled to give information
respecting the tradition that when Queen Elizabeth visited
Worcestershire she slept one night at a public-house, formerly
called the "Dog" inn, Hartlebury, and that she left at that
house one of her slippers as a pledge of her stay. She is
said to have granted to the above inn some privilege&mdash;such
as the exemption from taxes. About forty years ago the
Dog inn was occupied by one Mr. Prince, and the slipper
was then said to be preserved at the inn. It is now called
"The Dealers'" inn, and is in the occupation of Mrs. Cole.</p>


<h3>DR. PRATTINTON'S PAPERS.</h3>

<p>I should be glad to ascertain whether the extensive and
valuable collection of Worcestershire papers made by my late
friend, Dr. Prattinton, of Bewdley, and bequeathed by him to
the Antiquarian Society, have yet been arranged and indexed.
J. H. D., Bark Hill, Bewdley.</p>


<h3>THE PAGEANT HOUSE.</h3>

<p>Can any one supply information as to the Pageant House,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
an ancient building which formerly existed in this city.
Was it used for plays or trade pageants in connexion with
the guilds? And was it on or near the site of the present
Music Hall? An old document belonging to the Clothiers'
Company describes it as "neer unto the Corn-market of the
said city, adjoining on the south side to a house or tenement
now in the occupation of Thomas Hill, blacksmith; on the
east side to the town wall; on the north side to a house
in the possession of John Oliver; and on the west side to the
way that leadeth from Foregate to the said Corn-market."</p>


<h3>CURIOUS DISCOVERY.</h3>

<p>In removing the old church at Oldswinford a few years
ago there was an unavoidable exposure of coffins and human
remains, and in one of the coffins a lady was found full-dressed
in ancient costume, and an enormous multitude of
pins in her dress and lying strewed about. Was this connected
with superstitious motives, or in what other way
may the presence of the pins be accounted for?</p>


<h3>THE HOLY LOAF.</h3>

<p>In the Halesowen churchwardens' book (commencing <i>temp.</i>
Edward IV), among other entries is one in the year 1499&mdash;"Item,
for bred to the holy loffe for the township of Rommesley,
12d." In those days the elements for the sacrament
were taken from the people's oblations of bread and wine,
until at length wafers were substituted. It was the custom
for every house in the parish to provide in turn the "holy
loaf," and the good man or woman who provided it was
specially remembered in the church's prayers that day. As
the substitution of wafers generally took place in the twelfth
century, is not the above one of the latest instances of the
"holy loaf" on record?</p>

<h3>A SOUNDING NAME.</h3>

<p>Can any one throw light upon an inscription in Elmley
Castle churchyard, which records the death of John Chapman,
whose name, it is said, "sounds in (or throughout) the
world?" The following is the inscription:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">"Memori&aelig; defunctorum sacrum.
&#922;&#945;&#953; &#932;&#965;&#966;&#969;&#957;&#953;&#945;
</p>

<p>"Siste gradum, viator, ac lege. In spe beat&aelig; resurrectionis hic
requiescunt exuvi&aelig; Johannis Chapmanni et Isabell&aelig; uxoris, fili&aelig;
Gulielmi Allen de Wightford, in comitat. War. Ab antiquo proavorum
stemmate deduxerunt genus. Variis miserarium agitati
procellis ab strenue succumbentis in arrescenti juventutis &aelig;state,
pi&egrave; ac peccatorum p&oelig;nitentia expirabant animas.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Maij 10 die Anno Dom. 1677.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Sistite Pierides Chapmannum plangere, cujus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Spiritus in c&oelig;lis, <i>nomen in orbe sonat</i>."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>A correspondent observes&mdash;"Sir, I know the Elmley Castle
epitaph that has astonished you, and I am rather surprised
you havn't bottomed it. Why it's transparent as crystal,
and is simply a verdant try-on at a pun. '<i>Nomen in orbe
sonat</i>,' says Mr. Chapman's epitaph&mdash;and right enough too;
for what other name does so sound over the world as
Chapman's? 'Dealer and Chapman' is the generic designation
of the vendors of commodities from pole to pole, and so
the mystery fadeth."</p>


<h3>THE KING'S DUTY.</h3>

<p>In the register of Besford parish is an entry of
"King's duty paid for four christenings, 4s." In the Himbleton
register there are traces of a similar tax, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Baptisms in 1783, since the commencement of a late Act of
Parliament, to demand 3d. for each baptism."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
"Burials in 1783," ditto ditto.</p>

<p>"Examined and received the duty to 1st of Oct., 1785. For Ben
Pearkes, sub-distributor&mdash;J. Wensley."</p></div>

<p>I believe the duty on bachelors and widows, and on
marriages, births, and burials, was imposed in 1695. In that
year a charge is made in the parish books of St. Nicholas,
Worcester, for the King's tax for burials. By the Act 6th
and 7th William III, every clergyman was directed to keep
an exact register of all persons married, buried, christened,
or born in their respective parishes, under a penalty of
&pound;100 for every neglect. This regulation, however, was not
properly attended to for ten years afterwards. By the 4th of
Anne, chap. 12, sec. 10, it is mentioned that many of the
clergy not being sufficiently apprised of the full import of the
above Act, had incurred the penalties thereof, whereby they
and their families remained exposed to ruin; the Legislature
therefore directed that they should be indemnified from the
consequences of such omissions provided the duty for every
marriage, birth, or burial, should be really answered or paid,
or notified and brought in charge to the collector of the duties.
Can any one state how long this Act was in force, and when
it was allowed to expire?</p>


<h3>SCULPTURES ON CHURCHES.</h3>

<p>At the churches of Leigh and Rouse Lench, above the
doors, exteriorly, is in each case a niche containing a figure&mdash;one
of the Saviour, and the other supposed to be of St. Peter.
These examples of figures are of rare occurrence in consequence
of the destruction of all such representations and
images at the Reformation, and subsequently by the Puritans.
Above the western window of St. John's church, Bromsgrove,
are three figures of the full size of life, said to represent
St. Peter, St. Paul, and the Blessed Virgin. They are in a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
state of preservation, although they have no doubt been there
450 years, and very likely escaped mutilation at the Reformation
from the great height they are from the ground; for
the window is one of the highest, if not <i>the</i> highest, of all the
western church windows in the county. On the south wall of
Eastham church are two rudely carved bas-relievos, representing
apparently the two signs of the zodiac, Leo and
Sagittarius, and on the wall of the chancel arch, facing the
nave, are two similar carvings&mdash;the one of the lamb and
cross; and the other, two lions' bodies united in one head.
It is said the church belonged to the Knights Templars, and
hence these devices. The lamb and cross was one of the
ensigns of that body, but how do the other devices apply?
Are there any other similar relics in the county?</p>


<h3>THE FIRST WORCESTER PRINTER.</h3>

<p>John Oswen, of Worcester, who flourished about the
middle of the sixteenth century, was appointed by Edward VI,
the printer of all books for the service of the churches
in Wales and the Marches, and he first printed the New
Testament here. Mr. Eaton, of this city, has one of Oswen's
books in his possession; it is entitled "The Godly sayings
of the old auncient faithful fathers upon the sacrament of
the body and blood of Christ. Imprinted the xi day of
Oct. 1550, at Worcester, by Jhon Oswen. They be also to
sell at Shrewsbury." Are there any other specimens of his
printing existing in this city? Oswen printed twenty-one
books here.</p>


<h3>KING CHARLES'S STAFF.</h3>

<p>At the British Arch&aelig;ological Association's meeting in the
Isle of Wight, August, 1865, it was stated, in a paper
contributed by Mr. H. S. Cuming, that the gold-headed staff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
which Charles I leaned on during his trial, and the head of
which breaking off suddenly, made a great impression on the
King, as a bad omen, was in the possession of a lady residing
at Worcester. In the "Gentlemen's Magazine" for January,
1846, the cane was said to be in the possession of Mr.
Cooke, of Newclose, Isle of Wight. Which account is correct,
or has the relic (like many others) miraculously multiplied?
The writer would be glad to be informed if it is in Worcester,
and where it may be seen.</p>


<h3>GIANTS.</h3>

<p>In the churchyard of Ripple is a gravestone bearing the
following distich:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"As you passe by, behold my length,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But never glory in your strength."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The individual buried here was Robert Reeve, who died
in 1626, aged fifty-six. Tradition says that he was a giant
(7ft. 4in. high), the length of his body being indicated by
the distance between the head and foot stones of his grave;
and it is said that he met with his death through over-exertion
in mowing an acre of land one day in Uckingshall
meadow. But there is a similar inscription in Welland
churchyard, from which it would seem probable that it was
a general one, intended as well for individuals under the
standard height as for men of larger growth. Can any parish
clerk inform me of similar inscriptions elsewhere? In Burford
church, near Tenbury, is a monument to Edward Cornwall,
with his picture in a shroud, painted on board. Tradition
tells wonderful stories of his size and strength, and he is
there represented as 7ft. 3in. long.</p>


<h3>SAFFRON.</h3>

<p>Dr. Nash, in his "Worcestershire," says that great quan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>tities
of wild saffron (<i>Crocus sativus</i>) grow in the parish of
Kyre Wyard, south of Tenbury. If so, the naturalized
plant must point out that saffron was formerly extensively
cultivated at Kyre Wyard. Can any inhabitant of that
vicinity say if the crocus, from which saffron was made, <i>now</i>
grows to any extent in the parish, and if there is any tradition
about the cultivation of saffron. Shakspeare alludes to
"villanous saffron," which in his time so coloured silks,
bread, and everything, that people became sick of it, and so
it got out of fashion, and there was less demand for the drug.
The Easter simnels, however, used to be made yellow with
it to a late period, and perhaps some may be yet manufactured.
In Cornwall there is still a taste for saffron cakes, as I
observed this very year (1855) at Helstone, where I unexpectedly
bought one. The crocus that produces saffron must
not be confounded with the purple-flowered meadow saffron
(<i>Colchicum autumnale</i>), which is a very different plant. This
last bears the name of "Naked Ladies," from the flowers
springing from the ground without any investiture of
leaves.&mdash;L.</p>

<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">There</span> is an old saying at Honeybourne, near

<p>It is proverbial in Worcestershire that "you never hear
the cuckoo before Tenbury fair or after Pershore fair."
Tenbury fair is on April 20, and Pershore fair is on June 26,
which two dates pretty correctly mark the duration of the
cuckoo's visit.</p>


<h3>A HAPPY VILLAGE.</h3>

<p>The happy village of Norton, near Evesham, contains no
inn, public-house, meeting-house, lawyer, doctor, or curate!
(at least this was the case a few months ago, when the author
of this work was there.)</p>


<h3>A GREAT FLOOD.</h3>

<p>G. E. R., a correspondent at Kidderminster, has found the
following curious note on the fly-leaf of a rare tract, entitled
"The Infancie of the Soule, by William Hill. Printed at
the Signe of the Holy Lambe, 1605:"&mdash;"November ye 29,
1620. In the river Severn was the greatest flood that ever
was sinse the flood of Noah; there was drowned at Homtone's
Loade 68 persons as they whare going to Bewdley
faire."</p>


<h3>OLD FAMILY.</h3>

<p>In the Domesday Book, mention is made of a family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
residing at Bromsgrove, of the name of Dipple, and at the
present time there are living in that town three distinct
families of the same name, so that in all probability this
family never became extinct, and is therefore one of the
oldest in the county.</p>


<h3>BELLS AND BELL-FOUNDERS.</h3>

<p>The majority of the Worcestershire bells were cast by
Rudhall, of Gloucester, and his successor, Mears; Chapman
and Mears, of London, towards the close of the last century,
and T. Mears, of London, in the present, also have their
names in some places, as at King's Norton; but a correspondent
says he has one of Mears' lists, and finds only
nine of his peals in Worcestershire, viz., Dudley, peal of ten,
weight of tenor, 21 cwt.; Stourbridge, eight, tenor, 19 cwt.;
King's Norton, eight, tenor, 17 cwt.; St. John's, Worcester,
six, tenor, 16 cwt.; Fladbury, six, tenor, 13 cwt.; Longdon,
six, tenor, 12 cwt.; Cookley, six, tenor, 12 cwt.; Abberley,
six, tenor, 9 cwt.; and Stone, six, tenor, 6 cwt. On the
Tredington bells the names of G. Purdye and Mr. Bagly
appear (seventeenth century). The Clent bells are by Bagly,
whose services were much called into requisition in Warwickshire,
and it is said by enthusiastic ringers that the bells
cast by the Baglys are not to be surpassed in the country:
they are all light peals, with fine musical tones, and run
down as true as a musical instrument can do. At Tanworth,
Warwickshire, the tenor bell has this inscription:
"Richard Saunders of Bromsgrove made we all, 1710."
How long the trade of bell-founding existed at Bromsgrove
does not appear, but the bells of St. Helen's (1706), St.
John's (1710), and St. Nicholas (1715), were founded there by
Mr. Saunders. The Worcester foundry, which had existed
in Silver Street in the seventeenth century,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> had probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>closed at the above period when Bromsgrove was resorted to.
On the third bell of Himbleton church is the inscription:</p>

<div class="footnote">

</div></div>

<p>The Worcester foundry is also traceable on the bells of St.
Michael's, Worcester, Bishampton, Himbleton, and Grafton
Flyford, from 1660 to 1676; John Martin, of St. Martin's,
being the founder.</p>

<p>The Bretforton peal is by Westcote, of Bristol, 1823;
Lester and Peck, of London, founded some of the Halesowen
bells a century ago. Joseph Smith, of Edgbaston, and R.
Wells, of Aldbourne, others of them, at the beginning and
end of the same century. The old peal of bells, prior to
these, at Halesowen, it appears from the churchwardens'
accounts, were completed in 1518, and the bell-founder came
from Nottingham. Joseph Smith, of Edgbaston, also founded
the Alvechurch and Northfield bells&mdash;the first in 1711, the
latter in 1730. On the third bell at Alvechurch is the following
euphonious couplet:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If you would know when we was run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was March the twenty-second, 1711."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Alvechurch bells are kept in excellent condition by Billy
Bourne, a poor demented creature, who however is famous
for his skill in clock cleaning and his adhesiveness to the
church belfry, in which he sleeps regularly on a hard plank,
with an old mat for a coverlid; he has hardly ever been
known to miss ringing the matin bell at five and the curfew
at eight, and constantly defends the sacred precincts from all
resurrectionists by a rusty old sword and pistol.</p>

<p>The Northfield bells are distinguished by some original
versification, thus: On the first&mdash;</p>

<h3>TOBACCO.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sublime in hookahs, glorious in a pipe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When tipp'd with amber, mellow, rich, and ripe."<br /></span>

<p>The introduction of tobacco (now become so important
an article of general demand) is a subject worthy of a few
notes, especially as regards the traces of its cultivation and
consumption in this district. It is true that Worcestershire
cannot boast of being the first place in England where
"the wicked weed" was grown. That was an honour
claimed by our near neighbours of Winchcombe, in Gloucestershire,
who are said to have profited greatly (in a pecuniary
sense, I suppose) by its cultivation. Tobacco was,
however, grown at Worcester, Feckenham, Eckington, Pershore,
Upton Snodsbury, Pensham, Kempsey, and other
places in this county. The first mention of its use at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
Worcester is in the chamberlain's accounts for the year
1643, about fifty-seven years after its introduction to this
country. At that time it was evidently esteemed an especial
luxury. The entry is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Item: For one ounce of bacca which Mr. Maior sent for to
spend upon Colonel Sandys, and for tobacco pipe, eighteen pence."</p></div>

<p>The sum of 1s. 6d. being then equal to at least 10s. of
our present money, some idea may be formed of the scarcity
and value of tobacco in its earlier days. The Droitwich
corporation, it seems, were very liberal in the consumption
of the weed, for at a feast in 1656 it is recorded that the
sum of 9s. was spent "for tobacco of both sorts." This is
the first and only instance of "both sorts" being mentioned.
The price of the article had fluctuated in a most unaccountable
manner, for while in 1643 it cost 1s. 6d. an ounce at
Worcester (the same price which was given for it at Droitwich
in 1632), in 1646 it was entered only at 2s. 8d. per pound
by the constable of Droitwich, in his bill of charges for
soldiers who at that time had taken up their abode in
Dodderhill church, as a barrack. In 1659, "Mr. Maior
Ashbie," of Worcester, charges 6s. 8d. for a pound of
Spanish tobacco; but it is gratifying to observe that, in the
midst of this heavy expenditure on matters of luxury, some
compunction of conscience was evident from the fact that
the corporation made their pipes perform double duty,
frequent entries occurring of a charge of 6d. per gross for
<i>burning</i> them! The price of the article was much reduced
by the time of James II, when the "best Virginia" was
but 2s. per pound, and "two gross of best glazed pipes
and a box with them, 3s. 4d." Previous to that time tobacco
had become almost a necessary among the upper classes,
nor could the Parliamentary representatives of the city of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
Worcester be despatched up to town until the "collective
wisdom" had smoked and drunk sack with them at the
Globe, or some other hostelry.</p>

<p>As early as 1621 it was moved in the House of Commons
by Sir William Stroud, that he "would have tobacco banished
wholly out of the kingdom, and that it may not be brought
in from any part nor used amongst us," and Sir Grey Palmes
"that if tobacco be not banished it will overthrow one
hundred thousand men in England; for now it is so common
that he hath seen ploughmen take it as they are at plough."
At a later period of the century, so inveterate had the
practice become, that an order appears on the journals of
the House, "That no member of the House do presume to
smoke tobacco in the gallery, or at the table of the House,
sitting at committees." Indeed we are told by M. Jorevin,
who visited Worcester in the reign of Charles II, put up
at the "Stag inn," and published his doings in the "Antiquarian
Repertory," that the women smoked as well as the
men. As early as the end of the sixteenth century, complaints
were made of this "imitation of the manners of a
savage people," as it was feared that by this practice Englishmen
would degenerate into a barbarous state. So great
an incentive was it thought to drunkenness, that it was
strictly forbidden to be taken in any alehouse in the time
of James I, and his Majesty exhausted much ponderous
wit in attempting to cry down the weed; his celebrated
performance, "A Counterblast to Tobacco," denominating
it "the invention of Satan," and the custom of smoking as
"loathsome to the eye, hateful to the nose, harmful to the
brain, dangerous to the lungs, and in the black stinking
fume thereof nearest resembling the horrible Stygian smoke
of the pit that is bottomless."</p>

<p>In 1659, Wm. George, of Eckington, was indicted at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
Worcester County Sessions "for planting, setting, growing,
making, and curing tobacco there," on 400 poles of land,
and a fine of &pound;400 inflicted&mdash;the informer being Wm. Harrison,
of Pershore. Ralph Huntingdon, of Upton Snodsbury,
John Redding, of Kempsey, Humphrey Tay and Rd. Beddard,
of Eckington, and Edmund Baugh, of Pensham, were similarly
fined. In the above-mentioned year it was ordered
"that no person plant tobacco after January 1, 1660, according
to Act of Parliament, 12th Charles II, within England, to
sell, upon forfeiture of the same or value thereof, or 40s.,
for every rode or pole so planted, set, or sown, one moiety
to the King and the other to the informer; not to extend
to physick gardens in the university."</p>

<p>In 1662, letters were issued from the Lords of the Council
which commanded that "all tobacco planted within the county
of Worcester should be speedily destroyed by order of the
sheriff and justices of the peace," to whom the said letters
were directed; and for many years subsequent to that period
(as appears from the Sessions rolls) the chief constables of
this county sent warrants to the various constables for cutting
and destroying the weed, and regular returns were made by
them as to whether they had found any growing within their
constablewicks. The tobacco plant, I am informed (<i>Nicotiana
rustica</i>), still grows in a half naturalized state near Bewdley&mdash;in
the vicinity, no doubt, of spots where it was formerly cultivated.
This shows how easily tobacco might be produced
in England, if there were no prohibitory taxation opposed to
it. The following quaint stanzas are from a forgotten book
of "Gospel Sonnets," by Ralph Erskine, a Presbyterian
clergyman, whose object was to <i>improve</i> whatever subject he
touched upon, and thus he tunes his pipe in a</p>

<h3>HERMITAGES AND CAVES</h3>

<p>abound in Worcestershire. One of the most interesting of
them is that at Redstone, in a rock by the Severn, in the
parish of Astley. It was said to be "a place of great resort
for devotees of high quality in Papal times:" and the following
remarks respecting it occur in a letter of Bishop
Latimer, written from Hartlebury to Lord Cromwell, August<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
25th, 1538. The letter was printed in the Parker Society's
edition of his "Remains," p. 401: "Hereby is an hermitage
in a rock by Severn, able to lodge five hundred men, and as
ready for thieves or traitors as true men. I would not have
hermits masters of such dens, but rather that some faithful
man had it." Habingdon says he had heard "that many who
traffick'd on the river gave, as they passed by in their barges,
somewhat of their commodities to charity at this hermitage;
and to show how much great men have valued this place,
there appear in the very front of the hermitage the arms of
England, between those of Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, with
his crosses croslet on the right hand, and those of Mortimer
with an escutcheon ermine, quartered, as far as I can guess,
with a cross on the left; but these monuments of honour
are here so worn as they are instantly perishing." Nash
states that the hermitage was anciently the inheritance of
Sir T. Bromley, and, with two acres directly over the cell,
was let to a poor tenant. It was afterwards sold and turned
into an alehouse; and more recently it was converted into
dwellings, but which were most unfit for human residences.
Indeed, about thirty years ago a school was kept in a part of
the rock! The entrance to the hermitage is through what is
called the chapel; and an arched passage, with openings at
the sides, seems to have led to the dormitories (now formed
into dwellings), and to the right is the refectory. Over the
doorway is an opening which is reached by some steps in the
inside, and from which, according to tradition, one of the
monks would address the people and pray for the safety of
passengers crossing the ferry. Another tradition is, that a
subterraneous passage once led from the hermitage to the
priory, near the site of the present church.</p>

<p>Blackstone Rock, near the Severn at Bewdley, is also a
most interesting relic. Here is an hermitage, cut in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
rock, to which entrance is gained by a low doorway into the
kitchen, which has for a chimney a circular hole cut perpendicularly
through the rock; there are also a chapel, a pantry,
with a chamber over, an inner room, closets with loft over, a
study with shelves cut for books, and another opening in the
rock, either for a belfry or chimney. Small and rudely cut
openings in the rock served for windows. In the front of
the cell is a seat carved in the rock, from which the hermit
looked forth on the Severn (which then ran closer to the rock
than it does now) and the beautiful meadows and wooded
banks adjacent. There is a tradition that this was at one
time a smuggler's cave; it has of late been used as a cider-making
house, &amp;c.</p>

<p>About a mile from Stanford church is Southstone Rock,
said to be the largest mass of travertine hitherto discovered
in this country, extending for half an acre. Its
northern extremity terminates in a precipice, hanging over
a most romantic dingle. Some cells were formerly hewn in
the rock, and at the top was a chapel dedicated to St. John, on
the feast of whose nativity there was a solemn offering, after
which the assembly ascended, by stairs cut out of the rock,
to the chapel, where they finished their devotions, and afterwards
drank the waters of the well. This hermitage and land
belonged to the abbey of Evesham. From the Jefferies Manuscript
it appears that on St. John's Day a "pedling faire"
was kept here, when the young people treated their acquaintance
with roast meat, "ye smoke whereof yet remains upon ye
rock," and that a wooden offering-post was fixed in the rock,
having a cavity in it for money to pass into a hole underneath.
The offertory dish in which these offerings were made (an
exceedingly curious relic) was till lately in the possession
of the Winnington family, but is now lost.</p>

<p>A hermit's cell may be seen in the parish of Hartlebury,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
cut in a rock in a secluded part of a meadow belonging to the
glebe land; its roof is supported by two pillars, and two
deeply splayed holes are cut in the wall.</p>

<p>A cave once existed on the top of Bredon Hill (as we are
informed by Dr. Derham, who wrote about 1712); it was lined
with stalactical stones on the top and sides; but this was
believed to have been an ancient granary, as a quantity of
wheat was found near there at the beginning of the present
century, when a land-slip occurred. The cave was probably
destroyed by one of these land-slips.</p>

<p>At Drakelow, near Cookley Wood, is a sandstone ridge,
excavated and inhabited, that still bears the name of
"Hollyaustin," corrupted, probably (as Mr. Lees suggests),
from "holy Austin," or Augustine, a hermit that once resided
there. There is a cave also in "The Devil's Spittlefull," on
Blackstone Farm, in the Foreign of Kidderminster, and there
was a hermit's cell at the old Sorb-tree in the forest of Wyre.</p>

<p>In the Red Cliff, near Suckley, Mr. Allies states, is a
hole called "Black Jack's Cave," said to have been inhabited,
about ninety years ago, by a convict named Farnham, who
had returned from transportation before his time, and who
used to climb up this cliff with all the agility of a cat, even
when laden with the spoils of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The parish of Stone contains a rock in which is a cave
called "The Devil's Den," and some horrifying tales are
told of the fatal results which happened to persons who
attempted to penetrate therein.</p>

<p>There is a hole in a rock, called "The Fairies' Cave,"
in the hamlet of Alfrick.</p>


<h3>WORCESTERSHIRE DESCRIBED BY A
ROUNDHEAD.</h3>

<p>In the Essex papers published three or four years ago<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
the following description is given of this county and city, and
also of Hereford: "On the 30th, Wharton writes again&mdash;'Worcestershire
is a pleasant, fruitful, and rich country,
abounding in corn, woods, pasture, hills, and valleys, every
hedge and highway beset with fruit, but especially with pears,
whereof they make that pleasant drink called perry, which
they sell for a penny a quart, though better than ever you
tasted at London. The city is more large than any I have
seen since I left London; it abounds in outward things, but
for the want of the Word the people perish. It is pleasantly
seated, exceeding populous, and doubtless very rich, on the
east bank of that famous river the Severn, the walls in a
form of a triangle, the gates seven. There is a very stately
Cathedral called St. Mary's, in which there are many stately
monuments; amongst the rest, in the middle of the quire,
is the monument of King John, all of white marble, with his
picture thereon to the life. Sir, our army did little think ever
to have seen Worcester, but the Providence of God hath
brought us thither, and had it not, the city is so vile, resembles
Sodom, and is the very emblem of Gomorrah, and doubtless
it would have been worse than either Algiers or Malta&mdash;a
very den of thieves, and a receptacle and refuge for all the
hell-hounds of the country.' From Worcester, Essex sent
a detachment under the Earl of Stamford to surprise Hereford,
in which Nehemiah Wharton served. He states that
they got into Hereford by telling the Mayor that Essex was
at hand with all his army. 'The city is well situated on the
Wye, environed with a strong wall, better than I have seen
before, with five gates, and a strong stone bridge of six
arches, surpassing Worcester. In this place there is the
stateliest market-place in the kingdom, built with columns
after the manner of the Exchange; the Minster every way
exceeding Worcester; the city not so large; the inhabitants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
totally ignorant of the ways of God, and much addicted to
drunkenness and other vices, but principally unto swearing,
so that the children that have scarce learnt to speak, do
universally swear stoutly. Many here speak Welsh. Sabbath-day,
the time of morning prayer, we went to the Minster,
where the pipes played, and the puppets sang so sweetly,
that some of our soldiers could not forbear dancing in the
holy quire; whereat the Baalists were sore displeased.'"</p>


<h3>PECULIAR WORDS.</h3>

<p>Among the archaic or peculiar words used in Worcestershire
(as also in some of the neighbouring counties), are
the following: "Tabber," to strike repeated blows with
the fist; "heft," weight; "colly," the black from a tea-kettle
or from coal; "wowing," selling ale without a license;
"leazing," gleaning (this is used in many counties); "cott,"
or "Molly Cott," a nickname given to a man who interferes
unduly in domestic affairs; "lungeous," being awkward,
heavy, and dangerous in play; "off his head," deranged;
"squilt," a small wart or pimple on the skin; "moithered,"
a state of great bewilderment in the head; "glat," an
opening in a hedge; "unked," or "unkid," to denote loneliness
and awkwardness; "butty," a companion, also a sort
of overseer among colliers; "fettle," to mix or interfere
with, also means condition; "gain," and "kind," both words
used to represent the condition of crops or anything else the
appearance of which is promising; "dollop," a good share or
quantity. A person was cutting cloth, and was recommended
to rip it, as more expeditious. "That is not so good," he
replied, "because the thread <i>fazles</i>." A lady told her servant
the "string was broken;" the servant replied, "Yes, and
I tried to mend it, but I couldn't <i>odds</i> it." The servant
came from a village in Gloucestershire. "Odds it" means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
to <i>alter</i> it. The word is very common in Gloucestershire,
and in some parts of this county. In the above list several
words of Saxon origin are perceptible, showing that old
languages linger among the poorer classes longer than with
the better educated, whose vocabulary has been more enlarged
by finer, though perhaps not more expressive words,
which are constantly being imported from foreign sources.
Sir Thomas Phillipps, Bart., says: "I have recollected
a remarkable term which I heard formerly in Broadway.
It is the word <i>anant</i> or <i>enant</i>, spoken when it was intended
to express that one thing was opposite to another, by poor
people. "He lives <i>anant</i> such a place," "<i>anant</i> that yat,"
&amp;c. It is remarkable, because it is almost the Greek word
[Greek: enantios] &#949;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#959;&#962;. Are we to suppose it to have been introduced
when the Saxon kings adopted Greek phraseology and terms
in their grants to monasteries? Pershore, to which Broadway
belonged, was a Saxon monastery, therefore it is not
impossible but it may have been introduced by the monks
in their visits to Broadway."</p>


<h3>CURIOUS NAMES OF PLACES.</h3>

<p>An unusually large number of places in Worcestershire
in ancient times seemed to have been dedicated to the <i>Dii
Inferi</i>, as also to the more sprightly beings which have hardly
yet ceased to exist in our woods and groves, in shady glens,
and by babbling streams. The Devil's Leap is a deep dingle,
partly in Dodenham and partly in Hartley. There are the
Devil's Den, Hell Hole, and Death's Dingle, in Stanford;
this "den" is a black wood in a narrow dell, deeply enclosed
in entangled woods; and Mrs. Sherwood says that the country
people give it names which commemorate its former evil
character&mdash;"The Devil's Den" being the mildest of the
epithets bestowed on this sequestered scene. In the above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>-named
Hell Hole grows the plant called Devil's-bit, which,
tradition says, was given to heal man of any deadly wounds,
but when Satan saw what numbers of the human race it
deprived him of, he in spite bit the roots off, whereupon it
miraculously grew without those usually necessary appendages,
and this is the reason we find it growing apparently without
roots. There is the Devil's Pig-trough, near Leigh; and the
Devil's Bowling-green at Inkberrow, ironically so called, it
is said by Mr. Allies, as, till lately, it was one of the roughest
pieces of ground in that parish. The Devil's Spadeful is the
name of a large mound of earth near Bewdley, traditionally
said to have been so denominated in consequence of the great
impersonation of evil having once intended to drown the
Bewdleyites by damming up the Severn, but being misinformed
by a drunken cobbler as to the distance he had to go,
he dropped the spadeful of earth and decamped. This tradition,
slightly modified, is common in various counties, and is
one of a numerous class tending to mark the popular contempt
for Satan's want of sagacity. Hell Holes abound in the
county, and there is Hell Bank near Stourbridge, Hell Kitchen
near Newbold-on-Stour, and Hell Patch in Upton Warren.
Whether, however, these names had reference to the "shades
below" or originated in the Celtic word <i>hel</i> (to assemble) is
a question. In Shelsley Walsh is a place called Witchery
Hole; and the <i>souvenirs</i> of fairy-land are exceedingly
numerous in many parishes of the county, such as Hob's
Hole, in Offenham; Hob Moor, in Chaddesley Corbett; Little
Hob Hill, in Beoley; Little Dobbin's Hill, in the Berrow;
Dobbin's Meadow, in Mathon; Puck Meadow, in Hallow;
Puck Hill, in Himbleton; Puck Croft, in Powick; Puck Piece,
in Abbot's Lench; Pixam, or Pixies' Ham, in Powick; Cob's
Croft, in Dodderhill; in Northfield, several places called Hob,
Cob, and Jack; Impey, in Alvechurch; The Whistlers, in
Lulsley, and innumerable others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>While on the subject of curious names it may be mentioned
that at Bellbroughton the word "Bell" is constantly heard
ringing in your ears&mdash;such as Bell Hall, Bryan's Bell,
Moorhall Bell, Bell End, the Bell inn, &amp;c.; and at Hanley
Castle the word "End" is as frequently repeated, in Gilbert's
End, Church End, North End, Robert's End, Severn End, &amp;c.
There are also Hunt End, a straggling village near Crabb's
Cross; Dagtail End, near to Astwood Bank; Neen End,
near the Ridgway; Alcester Lane's End, between King's
Norton and the Birmingham road; and Holt End, at the
foot of Beoley Hill. It is probable that the addition of the
word "End" to so many places means that the spot so
designated is the extreme end of some enclosed plot of ground
or farm, as Robert's End, &amp;c. The Grimsend House in
Alfrick is situate at the extreme end of the estate, and there
is a place called Coppy (coppice) End or Ind in the neighbourhood.
With respect to Bellbroughton, it was called by
the prefix only in very early times, therefore that may
account for the names "Bell End," &amp;c., in that parish.</p>


<h3>THE CHINA TRADE.</h3>

<p>Mr. Thursfield, of Broseley, at the meeting of the Arch&aelig;ological
Institute, at Shrewsbury, in 1855, read a paper
in which he stated that about the year 1750, a manufacture
was commenced at Caughley, near Broseley, for the production
of porcelain, by two persons named Gallimore and John
Turner, the latter originally a silversmith at Worcester.
They carried on the works with considerable spirit towards
the close of the last century, having introduced several
French artisans. The distinctive mark of the Caughley
porcelain is supposed to be the letter S., and some pieces
bear the mark "Salopian." The manufacture continued
till 1799, when the works were purchased by Messrs. Rose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
and it was subsequently carried on at Coalport. During
Turner's management, Worcester porcelain was sent to
Caughley to be printed and coloured. The process of
printing decorations upon porcelain, originally invented by
Dr. Wall at the Worcester works, was transferred as it
is believed to Caughley, by R. Holdship, who had been
employed at Worcester in 1757.</p>


<h3>LONGEVITY.</h3>

<p>Chaddesley Corbett, Mamble and Bayton, Rock, Tenbury,
Martley, Abberley, and two or three other places in this
county, are famous for the longevity of their inhabitants.
Perhaps a larger number of very old people can be enumerated
in the neighbourhood of Martley and the Berrow hills
than in any other given space in the kingdom. The late incumbent
of Chaddesley, who was himself nearly 90 years of
age, buried, in 1813, Sarah Yates, at the age of 101; and in
1841 he did the same service for Elizabeth Young, aged 103.
At Feckenham, a Mrs. Eadee died, in 1802, at the age of 103.
At Abberley, Mary Bagnall died, in 1836, aged 102; and the
venerable rector of that parish, the Rev. F. Severne, is <i>only the
tenth incumbent</i> since the beginning of Elizabeth's reign&mdash;a
period of about three centuries! The grandfather of the present
rector held the living 48 years, his father a similar term,
and he himself bids fair to imitate the longevity of his
ancestors. Two of his predecessors who, as he also does,
held the incumbency of Kyre, held that living between
them for 108 years! The Rev. G. Williams, of Martin
Hussingtree, but recently deceased, held that living from
the year 1790; and it is said that some ale brewed when he
was first inducted was only drunk out (at the rate of a
bottle per annum, at the audit) just prior to his decease&mdash;an
instance of longevity quite as remarkable as any now being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
enumerated. The parish of Strensham has had only three
rectors in a century and a half. Betty Palmer, who was
born at Rock, died in 1782, aged 113; she had a sister and
three brothers: Richard lived to be above 100, and their
father and mother to 102 and 103. At Mawley, Jane Corkin
was living, in 1710, at the ripe age of 126. A man died
at Coreley, in 1849, aged 107 years 7 months. Mrs. Perkins
died near Tenbury, in 1810, aged nearly 105. Mr. Mapp, of
Shelsley, is, I believe, living in his 94th year; and the burials,
in 1853, of old people between 80 and 100 years of age, at
Rock and the vicinity, were remarkable. At Alvechurch is
an inscription to Joseph Davies, who died in 1831, "who
for nearly 70 years assiduously fulfilled the office of clerk
of this parish with a distinct, pleasing, melodious voice, and
inoffensive life, till within a few days of his death." A
Mrs. Elizabeth Bourne died at White Ladies Aston, in 1812,
aged 106. At Bredon, for the whole term between 1813
and 1846, the greatest number of deaths occurred between
the ages of 70 and 75. The celebrated Countess Dowager
of Coventry died at Holt in 1798, aged 96. At Henwick,
near Worcester, a person died recently who remembered
the coronation of George III, and others are still living
there between 90 and 100 years of age. There is a saying:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"All about Malvern Hill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A man may live as long as he will."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Dr. Addison, in 1834, showed that there were then living in
that parish, on the eastern side of the hill, nearly double
the number of persons, at 80 years of age, than were in
all England at the same rate of population; and at 90, three
times the number, without taking into account still older
persons. In January, 1835, at Great Malvern, there were
60 persons residing, who were 70 years and upwards. Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
Sarah Davis, of Rock, died on the 17th of June, 1856, at
the age of 103. She possessed all her faculties till within a
few hours of her death, and had only suffered a little lameness
from rheumatism. Till very lately she could see to
thread her needle, and had been employed for half a century
on Hollins' farm, as a market and charwoman. She had
been a spinster all her life, and had a strong aversion to
the male sex.</p>

<p>The Worcester papers of July 12, 1856, recorded the death
(on the 10th of the same month) of the Rev. James Hastings,
rector of Martley, in his hundred and first year, and also
that of Jane Doughty on the 8th, in her ninety-fifth year.
The latter was a very remarkable instance, because the poor
woman belonged to a class who enjoy but few of those comforts
which would seem necessary for the prolongation of life
to such a span. She had lived for many years in a humble
tenement in Pye Corner, Bull Entry&mdash;a situation which no
one would point out as apparently conducive to long life.
Formerly, she was a fruit-seller in Fish Street, and many of
the citizens probably recollect her as the little old woman
who used to take her seat on the Old Bank steps, with her
basket of fruit, &amp;c., for sale. Up to the last she could hear
and see well enough, and was only a little bent from age.
She would eat heartily, but of plain diet, and her neighbours
do not recollect her taking ale till the day before her death,
when she wished to have some, and it being brought, she
drank a good draught. A few hours only of indisposition
brought her to her end&mdash;being one of the rare instances of
really natural death (<i>i.e.</i> not dying from disease) which occur
amongst us. Deceased was the grandmother of Sergeant
Doughty, of the city police. She was born in the proverbially
healthy district of Martley (where also, it will be observed,
the other individual mentioned in this narrative formerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
resided); and married Abraham Doughty, sergeant in the
29th, at All Saints in this city. She had four children, all
of whom she survived, twenty-five grand-children, fifty great-grand-children,
and four great-great-grand-children. Previous
to her death, Sergeant Doughty could say what very
few can&mdash;that he had a grandmother and grand-children
living at the same time.</p>


<h3>GLOUCESTER CITY GATES.</h3>

<p>It is said in the history of Gloucester that shortly after
the Restoration of Charles II, the King, bitterly remembering
his father's defeat before that city, ordered the doors belonging
to the gates to be pulled down, and presented them to the
city of Worcester, which had long remained faithful to his
cause. On the south gate of Gloucester, which was battered
down during the siege by the King in 1643 (but was rebuilt
in the same year), was inscribed in capital letters round the
arch&mdash;"A city assaulted by man but saved by God: Ever
remember the 5th of September, 1643." This was the day
the siege was raised by Essex.</p>


<h3>ANCIENT INNS.</h3>

<p>The old Black Boy, at Feckenham, is now closed as an inn.
It had been in the family of the Gardners about 139 years.
The sign, which was of copper, stood the whole of that time,
until taken down in 1854.</p>

<p>The present occupiers of "Mopson's Cross" inn, near
Wyre Forest, boast that their ancestors have occupied that
inn for more than two centuries, and that it is the oldest
licensed house in the county. The Talbot inn, Sidbury,
Worcester, and the Talbot in the Tything, are very ancient,
and the County Sessions were formerly adjourned regularly
to those old hostelries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>


<h3>A FINE MEMORY.</h3>

<p>In Yardley church is a memorial to one of the Este family,
who, though blind, was said to have attained a perfect knowledge
of the Scriptures, by heart, from beginning to end.</p>


<h3>LONGDON MARSHES.</h3>

<p>The Longdon marshes (formerly a waste of nearly 10,000
acres) are believed to have formed a backwater of the Severn
estuary, subject to tidal influence, in those very ancient times
when, according to Sir R. Murchison, the "Straits of Malvern"
existed. Various sea birds still come there in the winter
season, as though a traditionary remembrance had been
wafted down among the feathered tribes of the time when
this wild spot was more particularly their own sporting
ground.</p>


<h3>HEREDITARY CLERKS AND SEXTONS.</h3>

<p>There are many instances in Worcestershire of the offices
of sexton and clerk having been held as hereditary ones for
very lengthened periods. At Feckenham, the late Mr. David
Clarkson (literally, the <i>clerk's son</i>), who died in March, 1854,
after having been a model clerk for many years, could boast
of his ancestors having occupied the same office for two
centuries. He served in his youth as drum-major in the
artillery, and when he succeeded his father in the clerkship,
became the tutor of choir after choir, and was the founder of
that celebrity which has long attached to the Feckenham
singers. He was also leader of the ringers. His death took
place in his 79th year, and he was greatly respected.&mdash;The
late clerk of Wolverley, Thomas Worrall (whose father had
been thirty years clerk, and to whose memory some curious
verses are inscribed on a stone in the churchyard), was him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>self
clerk forty-eight years, schoolmaster for thirty-three, and
registrar for a long period, besides being leader of the choir
and ringers. He was never absent from his duties at church
but twice!&mdash;The Field family have been connected with the
clerkship and beadledom of Kingsnorton for upwards of two
centuries. Two of them alone held it for <i>one hundred and
two years</i>! The last of the race, I think, died in 1818. The
Fields were an ancient family in that parish, for there is an
indenture in existence between William Wyllington and John
Field of Kingsnorton, dated the 30th year of Henry VIII.&mdash;The
family of the Roses has provided the church of Bromsgrove
with clerks and sextons time out of mind; and at
Belbroughton the Osbornes have done the same thing. One
of this family was clerk till a very recent period. It appears,
also, that the Osbornes had been tailors from very remote
time, and the late clerk had several brothers who followed
that very useful avocation. From a letter of Mr. Tristram
(then the patron of Belbroughton) to Bishop Lyttelton, the
Osbornes were tailors in the reign of Henry VIII, but they
can trace their descent much higher, having been lineally
descended from William Fitz-Osborne, who about seven
centuries ago unjustly deprived Ralf Fitz-Herbert of his
right to the manor of Bellem, in the above parish.&mdash;At
Oldswinford, on December 28th, 1855, died Charles Orford,
aged seventy-three; he had been parish sexton from his
youth, having succeeded his father in that capacity, and
leaving a son to follow.&mdash;The office of clerk at St. Michael's,
Worcester, has been in the family of Bond for nearly a
century.&mdash;John Tustin, the present clerk and sexton of
Broadway church, has held those offices fifty-two years,
and his father and grandfather also held them.</p>

<h3>THE REV. DR. LEE.</h3>

<p>The mansion of Glasshampton, in the parish of Astley,
was some years ago totally destroyed by fire. The Rev.
D. J. J. Cookes, on coming into possession of the property,
enlarged, repaired, and beautified the family seat. When
the work was nearly completed, a dinner was given to the
workmen in the mansion; but one tipsy fellow among them
let fall the contents of his pipe upon some shavings, and
the place was soon in a blaze. The entire edifice was
destroyed, but among the furniture saved was an organ
built by Green, the favourite artist of George III; it was
afterwards sold to the parish of St. Nicholas, Worcester, and
may be still heard in the church of that parish. Disastrous
as was the Glasshampton fire, it nevertheless was an auspicious
event for genius and literature, by bringing into notice
that remarkable man, the Rev. Dr. Lee, late Professor of
Arabic and then of Hebrew in the University of Cambridge.
At the time of the fire he was employed as a carpenter
in the mansion. The loss of his chest of tools and most of
his books in the fire compelled him to solicit pecuniary help
towards the purchase of another set. This circumstance
led to such a development of his character and attainments,
as resulted in his acquaintance with the late Archdeacon
Corbett, and his matriculation and career at Cambridge.</p>


<h3>THE MARTYR RIDLEY.</h3>

<p>In Redmarley church is an inscription to one George
Shipside, as follows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"All flesh is grasse worme's meat and clay, and here it hath short time to live,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For proofe whereof both night and day all mortall wights ensamples give.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath this stone fast closde in clay doth sleepe the corpes of George Shipside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wch. Christ shal rayse on ye last day and then with him be glorifide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose sovle now lives assvredly in heaven with Christ ovr Saviovr<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In perfect peace most ioyfvlly with Gods elect for evermore.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="center">Obit die De'bris An. D'ni 1609, Ac An. &AElig;tatis
sv&aelig; 84. Ecce quid eris."
</p>

<p>This is believed to be the George Shipside whose wife was
sister to the martyr, Bishop Ridley. The bishop had the
free warren of Bury Court, in this parish, and a George
Shipside was his sister's second husband; he was the bishop's
park-keeper at Bushley, was incarcerated at Oxford, and
attended the martyr to the stake. Ridley's affectionate farewell
on that occasion to George Shipside and his wife will
not be forgotten. Ridley was led to the stake in 1555, at
which time the above George Shipside was just thirty years
of age.</p>


<h3>VERSIFIED WILL.</h3>

<p>The following is a copy of the will of John Baxter, of
Conderton, Overbury, as proved in the Consistory Court of
Worcester, in 1724:</p>

<p>
"July the 25 Anno 1723;&mdash;<br />

</p>


<h3>BLOODY POND.</h3>

<p>In some of our old histories occasional mention is made of
pools suddenly changing from water to blood, or putting on
a sanguine aspect, which in those "muddy-evil" times was
considered a prodigy portending wars and direful slaughter.
A similar appearance was presented a short time ago
in a pool at Snead's Green, Mathon, in this county, the
surface of which was so closely covered with a film of crimson
and vermilion as to present a most extraordinary appearance.
The gentleman who first observed this sanguine aspect of the
pond, not thinking much of portents or omens, thought that
the rural wheelwright had been emptying some refuse red
paint in the water, which had got dispersed over the pond.
But on inquiry this was not the case, and botanical science
was then called in to solve the mystery. In the mean time,
more than a week having elapsed, the curious appearance
was almost gone when the spot was visited by some members<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
of the Malvern Club; but the clay on the margin of the
pool displayed several patches of what looked very much
like clotted blood, evidently the relics of what had been
previously seen. On these being examined by Mr. E. Lees,
who noticed the subject at a recent meeting of the Worcestershire
Naturalists' Club, they were found to consist of
innumerable minute globules containing a coloured fluid that
oozed forth into a gelatinous mass, leaving the globules empty
like small beads of glass; but so numerous and minute were
they, that 6000 were contained within the superficial space
of half a square inch. The bloody appearance was thus
occasioned by the sudden fructification of an algoid plant,
belonging probably to the genus <i>H&aelig;matococcus</i>, and allied to
the singular production called Red Snow, though appearing
in a different medium and under altered circumstances.</p>


<h3>CROMWELL'S PROPERTY AND INCOME-TAX.</h3>

<p>In 1656, Oliver Cromwell and his Parliament laid on a tax
very much like the present property and income-tax, and its
machinery of commissioners, assessors, &amp;c., was also very
similar. The commissioners for the county of Worcester
were&mdash;"Sir Thomas Rous, Baronet, John Wilde, sergeant-at-law,
Major-General James Berrey, Wil. Lygon, John Egiocke,
Edw. Pit, Hen. Bromley of Holt, Rich. Grevis, Nicholas
Lechmere, Gervase Buck, Wil. Geffreys, Joh. Corbet, Henry
Bromley of Upton, Edw. Dingley, Charles Cornwallis, Nich.
Acton, Rich. Foley, Walter Savage of Broadway, John Bridges,
Richard Vernon, Thomas Foley, Thomas Milward, Talbot
Badger, Thomas Tolley, John Latham, John Fownes, Theophilus
Andrews, William Collins, Esquires; Thomas Young,
Edmund Gyles, Edw. Moore, Nicholas Harris, Nicholas Blick,
John Corbyn, John Baker, Gentn.; the Mayor of Evesham,
Bayliff of Bewdley, and Bayliff of Kidderminster, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
time being; Edmund Gyles, one of the Masters of the
Chancery, Walter Gyles, Thomas Symonds of Peershore,
Gentlemen; John Nanfan, Edward Salwey, Esquires. For
the city of Worcester&mdash;Major-General James Berry, Edmund
Pit, John Nash, Edward Elvins, Henry Ford, Francis Frank,
Aldermen; Gervase Buck, Thomas Hall, Esquires; Capt.
Thomas Wells; Richard Henning, Anthony Careless, John
Higgins, William Cheatle, Arthur Lloid, Thomas Harrison,
John Philips, Thomas Baker the Elder, Foulk Estop, Richard
Ince, Robert Gorl, Gentn.; Edmund Gyles, one of the Masters
of the Chancery; Wil. Collins, Esq.; Tho. Hackett, Alderman."
To this tax the county of Worcester was to contribute
&pound;1013. 6s. 8d. per month, and the city of Worcester &pound;53. 6s. 8d.
per month, the value of the money in each case being then
about ten times as much as it is now, as farms which were
then let for &pound;100 a year are now let for nearly &pound;1000. The
ordinance by which this tax was imposed is the ordinance of
the Parliament, chapter 12, of the year 1656.</p>


<h3>GRAVEYARD PUNNING.</h3>

<p>Specimens of punning are sometimes to be met with in our
churches, and they will be found chiefly to belong to the
seventeenth century, when all kinds of odd conceits and
frippery in language abounded. In Eldersfield church, the
widow of "William Helme, gentleman," thus laments his
loss:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My ship, long on the seas of this world tost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of <i>helme</i> bereav'd, lo here is sunk at last."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>King's Norton church contains a monument to "Richard
Greves, of Moseley, Knight," part of which is made of
touchstone, and the inscription is in gold letters, concluding
thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Wherefore his name hath broke detraction's fetters,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And well abides the <i>touch</i> in <i>golden letters</i>."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>
<p>Affixed to the principal porch of Bromsgrove church is a
dial, at the bottom of which are the words "We shall;"
the constructors of the instrument having left its name to
complete the sentence, thus: "We shall (<i>dial</i>) die all." An
excruciating pun, forsooth.</p>

<p>In Ledbury church is an inscription to one Charles Godwin
and his wife, ending&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"<i>Godwyn</i> the one; <i>God-won</i> the other."
</p>


<h3>KNIGHTS OF THE ROYAL OAK.</h3>

<p>This order was intended by King Charles II as a reward
to several of his followers, and the Knights of it were to wear
a silver medal with a device of the King in the oak, pendant
to a ribbon about their necks; but it was thought proper to
lay it aside, lest it might create heats and animosities, and
open those wounds afresh which at that time were thought
prudent should be healed. There is, however, a manuscript
in the handwriting of Peter Le Neve, Esq., Norroy King of
Arms, the title of which is "A list of persons who were fit
and qualified to be made Knights of the Royal Oak, with the
value of their estates. Anno Domino 1660." This list contains
the name of Baronets, Knights, and Esquires, with the
value of their estates, and embraces every county of England
and Wales. The list, so far as it relates to Worcestershire, is
as follows:</p>

<h3>WORCESTERSHIRE MAGISTRATES IN 1483.</h3>

<p>The following are the names in the Commission of the
Peace and of Oyer and Terminer for the county of Worcester,
dated December 5th, 1st Richard III, as they occur on the
patent rolls of that year:</p>


<ul><li>J., Bishop of Worcester.</li>
<li>John, Duke of Norfolk.</li>
<li>John Sutton de Dudley, Knight.</li>
<li>Richard Ratcliff, Knight.</li>
<li>Humphry Starky, Knight.</li>
<li>Thomas Tremayle.</li>
<li>William Catesby, Esquire, of the Royal Body.</li>
<li>William Littleton.</li>
<li>Humphrey Stafford.</li>
<li>Roger Harwell.</li>
<li>Thomas Lygon.</li>
<li>William Lygon.</li>
<li>Robert Handy.</li>
<li>Robert Russell.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Bishop here mentioned was John Alcock, who was
Lord Chancellor in the reign of Henry VII; Humphrey
Starky was Lord Chief Baron in the reign of Richard III;
and Thomas Tremayle, a King's Serjeant, and afterwards a
Judge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>It is worthy of observation, that at this period the Commission
of Oyer and Terminer under which the criminal
business of the Assizes is still transacted was not separated
from the Commission of the Peace; and the very small
number of Magistrates is accounted for by the fact of so much
of what is now business at the Quarter Sessions, and before
Magistrates, going to the Sheriff's Torn and the Courts Leet,
of which Courts the Sheriff's Torn was the most important.</p>


<h3>NONCONFORMITY.</h3>

<p>From 1651 until 1834, a period of 183 years, the Baptist
Church at Bromsgrove had but five pastors, namely Revds.
J. Eccles, W. Peart, G. Yarnold, J. Butterworth, and J.
Scroxton. Mr. Scroxton resigned the pastorate at the above
date (1834), on account of his age, and died in 1854, at the
advanced age of 90. The first mention in history of Baptists
in this county was in 1645, and the first minister the
celebrated clergyman of Bewdley&mdash;the Rev. Dr. John
Tombes, a native of that borough. In early life this noted
individual studied at Oxford, and having made good use of
his time, he was, at the age of 21, chosen lecturer at Magdalen
Hall. In 1643 he held a private meeting with the
principal London clergy, to whom he avowed his belief in
adult baptism, and in the same year he transmitted his
belief to the Westminster assembly of divines, in a well-written
argument in Latin; the assembly, however, did not
send him a reply. He returned to his native place in 1645,
and both preached and administered baptism by immersion,
and formed in Bewdley a distinct church, which continues
till the present time. He also preached with great success
at Worcester and other places. His popularity procured
for him a great many opponents, and among others Richard
Baxter, who at that period (1648) resided at Kidderminster.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
Mr. Baxter courageously challenged Dr. Tombes to a public
discussion. This took place at Bewdley, on New Year's Day,
1649, before a large number of individuals, some of whom
came from distant parts of the country, including several
from the Universities. Wood, the historian, noticing this
controversy, says, "All scholars then and there present,
who knew y<sup>e</sup> way of disputing and managing arguments,
did conclude that Tombes got y<sup>e</sup> better of Baxter by far."
He also held several other discussions, both in England
and Wales.</p>

<p>The House of Lords, in their conference with the House
of Commons, on the "Occasional Conformity Bill," speaking
of him, says that he was "a very learned and famous man."
Among others he baptized at Bewdley were the Rev. Richard
Adams and John Eccles. Mr. Adams was a short time
afterwards ejected from his living at Humberstone, Leicestershire,
and, in 1651, was minister of Devonshire Square
Chapel, London. Mr. Eccles commenced preaching at Bromsgrove
in 1650, and soon afterwards formed the church there
which still exists. The opposition and persecution he met
with was very severe, but it appears that, notwithstanding,
the members greatly increased, for in 1670 there were 97
at Bromsgrove who professed the Baptist belief; at the
present time, although the population has more than doubled,
there are but 103. Mr. Eccles was for a considerable time
confined in a dungeon in Worcester gaol, but was restored
to liberty through the influence of Mr. Swift, M.P., one of
the county members, who was bound for him in &pound;1000 bond.
Dr. Tombes also suffered greatly, and on two occasions was
robbed of all he had by the King's forces at Leominster and
Bristol: at the latter place he narrowly escaped with his
life. Mr. Eccles continued at Bromsgrove till 1697, when
he retired to Salisbury, where he died (1711) at an advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
age, after being a minister upwards of 60 years. Dr. Tombes
retired to Coventry, where he died in 1676, aged 73. The
Baptist church at Worcester was founded in 1651; Pershore,
1658; and Upton-on-Severn, 1670. Several very noted individuals
have been baptized at Bromsgrove&mdash;David Crossley,
who became minister at Currier's Hall, London; Rev. R.
Claridge, M.A., rector of Peopleton, afterwards a noted
minister in the metropolis; Rev.&mdash;Miles, M.A., master
of Kidderminster Grammar School; Solomon Young, who
become tutor at Stepney College, &amp;c. During the ministry
of the Rev. G. Yarnold, at Bromsgrove, and principally by
a few of the Baptists of that town, the first Birmingham
Baptist Church was founded, 1737, in Cannon street, and
is at the present time the most influential and, with two
exceptions, the largest Baptist interest in the United Kingdom.
Another chapter on Nonconformity will be found
in this book.</p>


<h3>COMMUNICANTS IN 1548.</h3>

<p>The number of communicants at the holy sacrament in
1548 in thirty-five parishes in the diocese of Worcester is
given in the certificate of Colleges and Chantries, No. 60,
now remaining in the Carlton Ride Record Office. This
certificate was made by "Sir John Pakynton, Knyght, Sir
Robert Acton, Knyght, John Skewdamour, Esquyer, William
Sheldon, Esquyer, George Willoughby, William Grove, Willyam
Crouche, and John Bourne, Gentilmen," under a
commission from King Edward VI, bearing date the 14th
day of February, in the second year of his reign. This
certificate contains a column headed "The names of the
Townes and Parishes withe the nomber of hosslyng people
in the same;" and each entry is in the following form:
"1. The parishe of Saynt Ellyns within the said Citie,
wherein bee of hoselyng people the nombre of six hunderd."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>For the sake of brevity the names and numbers are here
given. It is impossible to give the population of these
places at the earlier date. The numbers of the communicants
were carefully preserved by the ecclesiastical authorities,
although the civil authorities paid no attention to the numbers
of the population; but it is curious to mark, at a time
when the numbers of the population must have been so
much less than at present, how large a proportion the
numbers of religious communicants in some instances bear
to those of the present population.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that the large numbers specified in
this certificate were not the numbers of actual communicants,
but merely the numbers of persons who were of an age to
be so, or perhaps the total number of communicants during
the year. This seems, however, not to have been the case,
and that these were the numbers of the <i>actual</i> communicants
is shown by the fact that in the certificates for Gloucestershire
and Wiltshire the numbers are equally high; and on the 14th
of May, 1637, the Bishop of Salisbury issued an injunction
to the curate and churchwardens of Aldbourne containing
(<i>inter alia</i>) as follows: "I doe further appoint that thrice
in the yeare at the least there be publique notice given in the
church for fower Comunions to be held vpon fower Sundaies
together, and that there come not to the Comunion <i>in one day
above two hundred at the Most</i>." The population of Aldbourne
is 1622. It has been suggested by a Roman Catholic
gentleman that, before the Reformation, if any one beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
the age of confirmation had not received the Holy Communion
at Easter, he would not be entitled to Christian burial if he
died within the year, unless some very special cause could
be shown. This also would go to account for the number of
communicants in the different places being very large.</p>


<h3>ASSIZE NOTICES.</h3>

<p>The costume of the Bench and the Bar is the first thing
which attracts the attention of the stranger visiting our
Courts of Justice, and on this we will remark, beginning with</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Wig.</span>&mdash;"All the wisdom's in the wig" is a saying
familiar to us all, and yet the wig was the latest addition
to forensic costume. The first species of wig worn in the
Courts is that now worn by the Judges at our Cathedrals,
called the <i>full-bottomed</i> wig. This was introduced by Louis
XIV in France, and copied by Charles II in England; and
after that it was worn down to the time of George II as the
full-dress wig of noblemen, generals, admirals, churchmen,
lawyers, and private gentlemen. It is still worn as the full-dress
wig of the Lord Chancellor, Judges of law and equity,
the Speaker, Queen's Counsel, Serjeants-at-Law, Masters in
Chancery, Recorders, and Judges of the Local Courts. In
one of Hogarth's prints of Speaker Onslow and several
members of the House of Commons, sitting in the House,
all are represented with the full-bottomed wig; and in the
prints of the same celebrated artist, Mr. Kettleby, who was
the last barrister who merely as a barrister wore the full-bottomed
wig, is so represented.</p>

<p>Mr. Meadows, of Gloucester, who is the oldest wigmaker
in this part of England, states that those wigs which had the
tails knotted were called "tie-wigs," and those short at the
back were called "bob-wigs." Thus, a Judge's <i>Nisi Prius</i>
wig was called a "friz-tie," it being frizzed all over; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
Bishop's wig being a "friz-bob." And it is stated by Mr.
Planch&eacute;, in his admirable little work on British costume,
that the tie-wig and the bob-wig were both introduced in
the reign of George II, the latter being sometimes worn
without powder. Mr. Planch&eacute; also informs us that the
bag-wig was introduced in the reign of Queen Anne.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Friz-tie Wig.</span>&mdash;This is worn by the Judges at <i>Nisi
Prius</i> and by the Judges of the local Courts, but this wig
was not originally forensic, as it appears in the portrait of
Mr. Beaumont, a London attorney of the reign of George II.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Two-curl Bob-wig.</span>&mdash;This was a powdered wig with
a peak in front, frizzed all over, except two rows of curls
all round the bottom of the back of it. It was worn by
Judges when opening the commission, and down to the time
of Lord Denman, when they received the Magistrates and
the Bar at dinner in the circuit towns; and down to the
time of Baron Garrow, when the Judges dined with our
Diocesan or Lord Lieutenant, they wore this wig, a black
silk gown, and bands. This species of wig was worn by
private gentlemen at the beginning of the reign of George
III; and Mr. Walter Horton, an eminent shoe manufacturer,
at Stafford, who died about 1776, is represented wearing this
wig in his portrait, now in the possession of Dr. Knight,
the physician and magistrate at that place, who married
his granddaughter and co-heiress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Curl Tie-wig.</span>&mdash;This is the Barrister's wig. It was
worn by the late Lord Melville when at the House of Lords,
although he was not a barrister. This noble Lord died
in 1811.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Scratch-wig.</span>&mdash;This was a brown wig curled all over,
worn by the Judges in the streets, with a hat now only worn
by Bishops and dignified clergy. This wig was introduced
by George IV when Prince of Wales, and was worn by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
Judges when not in Court, down to the time of Lord Gifford.
It was stated by Mr. Meadows that all these wigs were well
known by their names before-mentioned when he was an
apprentice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Moustache.</span>&mdash;On the Bench and at the Bar the moustache
was the immediate predecessor of the wig. In the
reigns of Queen Elizabeth and Kings James and Charles I
the Bench and the Bar wore moustaches, as may be seen in
the council-room at Lincolns' Inn and elsewhere in the portraits
of Lord Coke, Lord Hale, Lord Keeper Coventry, Lord
Ellesmere, and many others. In the reign of King Charles
II the moustache generally disappeared, and on went the
wig; but there is in Berkeley Castle a fine portrait of King
Charles II, by Sir Peter Lely, in which that monarch is represented
in a large full-bottomed wig, like that of a Judge at
our Cathedral, with the exception of the powder, and wearing
a small but well-trimmed moustache. The moustache, however,
which had been almost universally worn by all (ecclesiastics,
lawyers, and laymen, Archbishop Laud included), did
not reappear at the Bar till very recently, when it was worn
in our Courts by Mr. Bernhard Smith, Mr. Chandos Pole,
Mr. Woodhouse Owen, Mr. Compigne, and other members
of the Oxford circuit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Band.</span>&mdash;Dr. Burn, in his "Ecclesiastical Law," in
treating of the costume of the clergy, says&mdash;"The band is
not so ancient as any canon of the church. Archbishop Laud
is pictured in a ruff, which was worn at that time both by
clergymen and gentlemen of the law, as also long before,
during the reigns of King James I and Queen Elizabeth.
The band came in with the Puritans and other sectaries upon
the downfall of Episcopacy, and in a few years more became
the habit of men of all denominations and professions." It
was worn by Oliver Cromwell; and in the portraits of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
of the Judges (<i>temp.</i> Charles II) in the Courts at Guildhall,
London, the band appears to be nothing more than the ends
of a turn-down collar, of the kind worn by young boys now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Gold Collar.</span>&mdash;This is worn by the two Lords Chief
Justices and Lord Chief Baron, and is called the collar of
Esses, from the letter S occurring in it. The origin of this
is not known: it was worn by the personal friends of Henry
IV, and is found represented on the monuments of noblemen,
warriors, and even ladies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Scarlet Robe.</span>&mdash;This is of great antiquity. Lord
Chief Baron Cassy is represented wearing such a robe on
his monument in Deerhurst church, near Tewkesbury; he
died 1401.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Black Silk Gown.</span>&mdash;This is an undress gown of the
Lord Chancellor, Judges, Queen's Counsel, and Serjeants-at-Law,
none of them wearing his full dress gown in an assize
town except the Judges. The Queen's Counsel's full dress
gown is of figured black silk, tufted all over like a parish
clerk's. The serjeant's full dress is a cloth robe, scarlet for
state occasions, black in term time, and purple on the red
letter days of the almanac if in term.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Tippet.</span>&mdash;This is a piece of cloth about two feet long,
shaped something like a gun-case; it is worn by the Judges
in the Crown Court, and by the Serjeants in term time, hung
from the right shoulder by a strong metal hook. The tippet
is mentioned as a portion of ecclesiastical costume in the 74th
canon of 1603. In a very interesting article, which recently
appeared in the "Quarterly Review," entitled "Rubric against
Usage," some question is raised as to what the tippet was, but
on this there ought to be no doubt, as it is still worn by the
Judges and Serjeants-at-Law.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Black Silk Scarf.</span>&mdash;This is worn by the Judge in
the Crown Court; it is the same as the scarf worn by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
clergy, and is evidently derived from the stola, an ecclesiastical
vestment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Black Silk Girdle.</span>&mdash;This is worn by the Judge in
the Crown Court; it was a part of the civil costume of the
reign of King Henry VII, and is often seen represented in
monumental brasses of that period.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Hood.</span>&mdash;Judges sometimes wear the ermine hood
with their scarlet robes. The barrister has a black hood
(useless from its small size) attached to the back of his
gown.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Judge's Court Hat.</span>&mdash;An equilateral cocked hat.
The gentleman's hat <i>temp.</i> George II.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Black Coat and Waistcoat.</span>&mdash;The bar did not uniformly
wear these till after the general mourning for Queen
Anne. Before this time the barristers wore coats and waistcoats
of any colour under their gowns, as the undergraduates
of Oxford do now. But at this general mourning the Judges
thought that the bar in the uniform black dress looked so
well that they suggested its continuance, and it has been
continued ever since. Indeed, it seems to be pretty clear
that a black waistcoat was not always a part of the costume
of the bar, as even now, on full dress occasions, the Queen's
Counsel wear waistcoats of gold or silver tissue, or of white
silk embroidered with coloured flowers. On ecclesiastical and
forensic costume in general the Rev. Dr. Burn (before cited)
observes that "most of the peculiar habits, both in the
Church and in Courts of Justice, and in the Universities,
were in their day the common habit of the nation, and were
retained by persons and in places of importance only as
having an air of antiquity, and thereby in some sort conducing
to attract veneration, and the same, on the other
hand, in proportion do persuade to a suitable gravity of
demeanour, for an irreverent behaviour in a venerable habit
is extremely burlesque and ungraceful."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Barrister's Bag.</span>&mdash;At present the younger barristers
have blue bags, the elder having red ones. Down to the
reign of George IV no barrister carried a bag in Court unless
it had been given to him by a King's Counsel, which arose in
this way. Down to that period the King's Counsel had no
salaries, but each was allowed <i>every year</i> a ream of foolscap
paper, a ream of draft paper, six pieces of red tape, six bags,
a penknife, a paper of sand, and a paper of pins. These
bags being more than they wanted for their own use, some of
them were given by them from time to time to their younger
friends, who were getting into business, to entitle them, as
the phrase was, "to carry a bag," the clerk, who was the
bearer of the present, having a fee of a guinea for it. But
at last the King's Counsel complaining that the paper was
bad, the amount paid by the Government for the allowances
was given to them instead, and so matters continued until
Mr. (afterwards Lord) Denman was appointed King's Counsel,
when fearing that this commuted allowance might be the
means of vacating his seat in Parliament, he was appointed
King's Counsel "without any fee, gain, or reward whatsoever,"
and so have been all the King's and Queen's
Counsel ever since.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Opening the Pleadings.</span>&mdash;At present the junior counsel
for the plaintiff, in a <i>Nisi Prius</i> cause, shortly states the
effect of the pleadings. This is called "opening the pleadings."
This practice was introduced at the suggestion of
Lord Mansfield, early in the reign of George III. The
<i>Nisi Prius</i> business in London was then monopolised by
Sir Fletcher Norton, Mr. Dunning, and a few other leaders,
and to throw something into the hands of the juniors Lord
Mansfield suggested the practice that in every case where a
King's Counsel was alone for the plaintiff a junior should
have a guinea fee to state or open the pleadings. This was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
acceded to; but as the clients thought this of no use to them,
they had a second brief delivered to a junior with two guineas,
and the junior then assisted the leader throughout the cause,
as the practice is now; but even at present, if a plaintiff has
only engaged Queen's Counsel or Serjeants, the youngest
counsel present is paid a guinea to open the pleadings only,
and do nothing more in the cause; and this is called a
"kite."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Assize Balls.</span>&mdash;The late Mr. Bellamy, who went the
Oxford and other circuits for sixty-two years, and who
died in 1845, remembered that in every county on this
circuit there was an assize ball on the commission day of
each assize. This ball was attended by the nobility and
gentry of the county and the Judges and Bar. The Judges
used to wear to the balls the black silk gown, band, and
the two-curl bob-wig. They were attended by the High
Sheriff, wearing a full court dress, bag-wig, and sword; and
his chaplain, in his gown, cassock, and band. The Judges
did not dance, but they usually played at whist. The assize
ball was continued in Buckinghamshire within the memory
of the Rev. Edward Owen, one of the present magistrates
of that county.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Courts.</span>&mdash;In the recollection of Mr. Bellamy, in every
assize town on the Oxford circuit the two Courts were held
in the same room, without any division or partition, so that
one Judge could see the other. This continued at Gloucester
till the year 1816, and the alteration was occasioned by this
circumstance: Baron (then Judge) Bayley was trying a
man for murder, and his jury burst into a laugh at one
of Mr. Dauncey's jokes in a horse cause in the other Court.
The learned Judge thought it was time this was altered.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Assize Presents.</span>&mdash;Formerly the Judges on their circuits
had an immense number of presents&mdash;venison, fruit, wine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
&amp;c.&mdash;which half kept their house during the assizes; but
in the year 1794, when so much was subscribed for the
defence of the nation against the threatened invasion, the
value of the different presents was subscribed, and the presents
discontinued, and never again renewed. About thirty
years ago a story was current in Worcester that the Mayor
always sent the Judges a present of a loaf of sugar, and
that the Judges in return invited the Mayor to dine with
them; but that the Mayor being once uninvited, the sugar
was discontinued ever after. Till the passing of the Municipal
Reform Act the Corporation of Gloucester always sent each
Judge in spring a salmon and a house lamb, and in summer
a salmon and a whole sheep; and at present the Corporation
of Oxford give to each Judge a pair of white kid gloves,
edged with gold lace, and ornamented with gold tassels.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The High Sheriff's Costume.</span>&mdash;Of late years, in Worcestershire,
the High Sheriff has dressed as any other gentleman.
In Berkshire and Oxfordshire the High Sheriff's costume is
a court dress, and it was so till lately in Gloucestershire
and Monmouthshire; but as the present court dress was
first introduced in the early part of the reign of George III,
the bag-wig in the reign of George II, and as swords were
worn by all the gentlemen as part of their usual evening dress,
within the memory of Mrs. Hannah Shenton, of Stafford, who
is now living at the advanced age of ninety-seven, it is manifest
that the High Sheriff only appeared in the full dress of a
gentleman of his time. And as a further proof that the
costume of the High Sheriff was the full dress of the private
gentleman of the period, there is a portrait of Francis
Goddard, Esq., High Sheriff of Wiltshire, in the reign of
King William III, now in the possession of Major Goddard,
of the Wilts Militia, in which the High Sheriff is wearing
a full-bottomed wig.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Javelin Men.</span>&mdash;These, no doubt, were the vassals and
retainers of the High Sheriff, who attended to protect and
guard the Judges, the weapon they carried being the <i>partizan</i>,
which is still carried by the yeomen of the guard, which
was introduced in the reign of Henry VIII. Mr. Aubrey,
the Wiltshire antiquary of Charles II's reign, in a letter
published by him in a work called "Miscellanies on several
Curious Subjects," says, from information obtained from his
grandfather (<i>temp.</i> Henry VIII)&mdash;"Lords had their armouries
to furnish some hundreds of men. The halls of Justices
of the Peace were dreadful to behold: the screens were
garnished with corslets and helmets, gaping with open mouths
with coats of mail, lances, pikes, halberts, brown-bills, batterdashers,
bucklers, and the modern calivers and petronels
(in King Charles I's time turned to muskets and pistols).
Then an esquire, when he rode to town, was attended by
eight or ten men in blue coats with badges;" and it would
seem that from the reign of King Charles II the javelin
men have continued to be much the same as at present, as
in the printed articles of agreement entered into in that
reign by sixty-four Wiltshire gentlemen, who were liable to
serve the office of High Sheriff, it is stipulated (<i>inter alia</i>)
"That no one of the said persons, when he is made sheriff
of the said county, have above thirty livery-men, nor under
twenty, for his attendance at the assize. * * * And that
when any of the said subscribers shall be made sheriffs of
the said county, the livery shall be a plain cloth coat or
cloke, edged and lined through with sarge, a black hat, and
suitable javelin." This curious document, which was signed
by one of his ancestors, still remains in possession of Major
Goddard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Trumpeters.</span>&mdash;These were part of the state of every
Nobleman, Bishop, and High Sheriff. Mr. Aubrey, in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
letter before cited, says&mdash;"The Lords kept trumpeters, even
to King James;" and as late as the reign of George II
there were trumpeters in the establishment of the Archbishop
of Canterbury. At ancient banquets, trumpeters were always
in attendance. At the Peacock Feast given by Robert
Braunche, Mayor of Lynn, to King Edward III, and represented
on the tomb of that magistrate, in Lynn Church,
the sonorous blast of the trumpets accompanies the introduction
of the viands; and at the Lord Mayor's Dinner at
Guildhall, on the 9th of November, every toast is announced
with a flourish of trumpets, at the top of the hall, which
is answered by another flourish from the bottom.</p>


<h3>JOHN TALBOT, ESQ., OF SALWARPE.</h3>

<p>John Aubrey, Esq., F.R.S., in his Natural History, written
between the years 1656 and 1691, says (p. 70)&mdash;"Dame Olave,
a daughter and co-heire of Sir Henry Sharington, of Lacock,
being in love with John Talbot, a younger brother of the
Earle of Shrewsbury, and her father not consenting that she
should marry him, discoursing with him one night from the
battlements of the Abbey church, said shee, 'I will leap
downe to you.' Her sweetheart replied he would catch her
then, but he did not believe she would have done it. She
leapt down, and the wind, which was then high, came under
her coates, and did something breake the fall. Mr. Talbot
caught her in his armes, but she struck him dead. She cried
out for help, and he was with great difficulty brought to life
again. Her father told her that since she had made such a
leap she should e'en marrie him. She was my honoured
friend, Colonel Sharington Talbot's grandmother, and died at
her house at Lacock, about 1651, being about a hundred
yeares old." To this passage the veteran antiquary, John
Britton, Esq., F.A.S., has added this note: "Olave, or Olivia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
Sherington married John Talbot, Esq., of Salwarpe, in the
county of Worcester, fourth in descent from John, second
Earl of Shrewsbury; she inherited the Lacock estate from
her father, and it has ever since remained the property of
that branch of the Talbot family, now represented by the
scientific Henry Fox Talbot, Esq." Sir Henry Sherington
was the son of Sir William Sherington, one of the ecclesiastical
commissioners for Wiltshire on the dissolution of the
Chantries; and to him Henry VIII granted the possessions
of Lacock Abbey, and a good deal of other monastic
property in Wiltshire. Mr. Aubrey was one of the original
members of the Royal Society. He attended Charles II and
his brother, afterwards James II, on their visit to the
Druidical Temple, at Avebury, in 1663; and dined with Oliver
Cromwell, the Protector, at Hampton Court, in 1657 or 8, as
is stated in his work before cited, pp. 97 and 103.</p>


<h3>KING'S NORTON LIBRARY.</h3>

<p>An interesting relic of the seventeenth century exists in
the old Theological Library in the School in King's Norton
churchyard, founded by Thomas Hall, the ejected Puritan of
1662. Hall is well known to literary men as the author of
"Funebri&aelig; Flor&aelig;, or Downfal of May-day Games," the
"Treatise against Long Hair," and other works. An interesting
sketch is given of him by Calamy, in his account of
the ejected ministers, affixed to his life of Baxter; and also
by Wood, in his "Athen&aelig; Oxonienses." The library consists
of from six to eight hundred volumes, of all sizes, ranging
from about 1580 to 1645 or 1650, and the books contain the
name of the donor on the title-page. All the works are
devotional, and many of them controversial. There are discoveries
of and safeguards against the subtleties of Jesuitism,
and against the then recently propounded notions of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
Quakers, as well as treatises on doctrinal points, commentaries
on the Scriptures, translations from Ovid, and sermons
preached before Parliament. The entire collection shows
strikingly how, even in the stirring times of civil war, a
minister could devote himself to the duties of his sacred
calling; and, judging from the evidence presented by his
choice, how completely he could isolate himself from the
seductions even of theological polemics, for the grand old
truth held by all orthodox Christians. It is to be regretted
that the library is so little known. It is said that a similar
library was established at the little village of Sheldon, near
Yardley.</p>


<h3>OLD ENGLISH RATS.</h3>

<p>The old English black rat (<i>Mus rattus</i>), which has been
nearly superseded in this country by the brown Norway rat,
still lingers at retired farmhouses in this county, as, for
instance, at Grimsend, Alfrick, Clay Green, and Wick, near
Worcester. The brown rat was unknown in England till
1730. It is said that the great numbers of these intruders
in the Isle of France drove the Dutch from that settlement.</p>


<h3>PAPER.</h3>

<p>The earliest mention of the purchase of paper in England
is believed to be in an original computus roll of the 43rd
year of Edward III (nearly five centuries ago) relative to
the receipts and disbursements of Halesowen Abbey; it is as
follows: "Et in paper empt. pro literis et aliis necessariis
domus, 12<i>d.</i>"</p>


<h3>ANCIENT SEAL OF WORCESTER.</h3>

<p>After being lost for half a century, the seal of the Corporation
of Worcester has been found at Rouen, in Normandy.
The antiquity of this seal is not so curious, perhaps, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
locality where it has been found. The device is a church,
surrounded by a wall, having battlements on it, and round
the device is the inscription&mdash;"<span class="smcap">SIGILLUM COMMUNE CIUIVM
WIGORNIE</span>," with something like the date "952." The figures,
however, are very indistinct, though it is supposed by a writer
in the "Worcester Herald" that they may refer to the date
of King Edgar's reign, who was a great friend to the city
of Worcester, and might have fortified it about that era;
but then the use of figures was not adopted in England,
or in Europe generally, till some centuries after the date
assigned.</p>


<h3>DESTROYING AN IMAGE AT WORCESTER.</h3>

<p>In Macaulay's "History of England," vol. iv, p. 461, it is
stated, that when the Dutch army was marching from Torbay
towards London, in 1688, Sir Edward Harley, of Brampton
Brian, and his son Robert (afterwards, as Earl of Oxford,
Queen Anne's minister, and a high churchman) declared for
the Prince of Orange and a free parliament, raised a large
body of horse, took possession of Worcester, and evinced
their zeal against Popery by publicly breaking to pieces,
in the High Street, a piece of sculpture which, to rigid
precisians, seemed idolatrous.</p>


<h3>EAST WINDOW OF ST. JOHN'S CHURCH.</h3>

<p>"A Stranger," writing to one of the local newspapers a
few months ago, drew the attention of antiquaries to some
painted glass in the great east window of the above church
which is not noticed by Dr. Nash or Mr. Green, the Worcester
historians. There is (he says) a head with long flowing hair
and a forked beard, and another head with the face close
shaven and a coronet. The first of these, I should suggest,
was painted in the reign of Richard II; on his tomb in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
Westminster Abbey there is his effigy with a forked beard;
and on the tomb of Edward III, in the same place, his effigy
has the long flowing hair. The head with the coronet is
exactly like one in the great church in Cirencester, of which
there is a coloured engraving in Mr. Lyson's Gloucestershire
Antiquities: that is supposed to be the head of Edward IV's
father, whose "feodary" (an official something between
an English steward and an Irish middleman), built this
part of the church. Dr. Nash mentions two circumstances
connected with St. John's which coincide with these dates.
He says that in 1371, only six years before the reign of
Richard II, William de Lynne, Bishop of Worcester, suppressed
the Chapel of Wyke and constituted St. John's a
vicarage; and that in the first year of the reign of Edward
IV, the Prior of Worcester granted to the Corporation the
privilege of attending Divine service at the Cathedral with
their officers, but if any officer should arrest, or do any act in
the monastery sanctuary, <i>or St. John's</i>, he should "forfeit
his mace and office without any hopes of restitution." This
grant is witnessed by John Carpenter, then Bishop of Worcester;
Sir Thomas Littleton, Serjeant-at-Law (the very
celebrated Judge who was buried, in the Cathedral); and
others. There is also a figure kneeling. This is a Saint, as
he has the nimbus round his head, and from his young and
beardless face it is probably St. John. There is also between
this figure and the coroneted head a grotesque head with
the mouth open and the tongue protruded. This I never
before saw in a window, or inside a church, though it is very
common in carving on the outside of churches. These
grotesques are by some supposed to represent the deadly
sins&mdash;the evil passions and the like. May not this device be
founded on <i>Isaiah</i> ch. lvii, v. 4?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>


<h3>BISHOP THORNBOROUGH'S MONUMENT.</h3>

<p>The Rev. O. Fox, incumbent of Knightwick-cum-Dodenham,
late head master of the Worcester College School, has
advanced the following ingenious theory to account for the
remarkable epitaph on the above monument in the Lady
Chapel of Worcester Cathedral, which has long puzzled our
local and other antiquaries. The epitaph (he says) was
prepared by the Bishop himself fourteen years before his
decease in 1641, at the age of 94. He was addicted to
alchemy, and published a book in 1621, entitled [Greek: Dithothe&ocirc;rikos] &#916;&#953;&#952;&#959;&#952;&#949;&#969;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962;,
<i>sive, Nihil aliquid, omnia, &amp;c.</i> In the course of some recent
studies in the Pythagorean philosophy, my attention was
accidently engaged by this inscription; and it at once struck
me that it was thence that the explanation was to be derived.
The epitaph is as follows: on one side,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Denarius Philosophorum, Dum Spiro Spero."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>on the other</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In Uno, 2<sup>o</sup> 3<sup>o</sup> 4<sup>o</sup>r 10. non Spirans Sperabo."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The two latter letters are now effaced.</p>

<p>It is well known that the Pythagoreans found all the
modes of space in the relations of numbers.</p>

<p>The monad, or unit, was not only the <i>point</i> whence all
extension proceeds, but it further symbolised the First Principle,
the origin of all. The decad represented the line, as
being bounded by two points or monads. The triad stood for
surface, as length and width. The tetrad for the perfect
figure&mdash;the cube, length, depth, and width. The decad, or
denarius, indicated comprehensively all being, material and
immaterial, in the utmost perfection: hence the term <i>decas</i>,
or <i>denarius</i>, was used summarily for the whole science of
numbers, and in the title of Meursius's tract, "De Denario<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
Pythagorico," which was published four years after the date
of the inscription, and when the philosophy was attracting
much attention among European scholars. To be as concise
as possible, then, I presume that the old bishop intended that
the tomb on which his effigy lies was his access to that perfection
of existence which philosophers had designated by
the <i>decas</i>, or <i>denarius</i>. During the present life he was hoping
for it. "<i>Dum Spiro Spero</i>."&mdash;On the other side: "In Him,
who is the source, the beginning, the middle, and the end of
all existence and perfection (in <i>Uno</i>, 2<sup>o</sup>. 3<sup>o</sup>. 4<sup>o</sup>r 10. <i>non Spirans
Sperabo</i>), though I breathe no more, yet shall I hope."</p>

<p>Such is probably the meaning of his pious conceit, and I
offer it as a solution of what has long served for a riddle to
the visitors of our Cathedral. Beyond this, your readers
and myself may be equally indifferent to such cabalistical
quaintness. But let us treat it with charity, as the devout
consummation of an aged alchymist.</p>


<h3>VINEYARDS.</h3>

<p>Traces of ancient vineyards are abundant in this county.
At Great Hampton is a place called "Vineyard Hill,"
where a vinery was established in the Conqueror's time.
("<i>Et vinea novella ibi</i>," Domesday.) In South Littleton is
"Vineyard Orchard," "Vine Street" in Evesham, and "Vineyard
Hill" near that town. At Pensax is a field called "The
Vineyard," and there is a tradition that a Mr. King, about a
century ago, endeavoured to establish there a vineyard of
considerable extent, and created an artificial atmosphere by
means of flues spread over the piece of land. The appearance
of the field justifies the tradition. Is there any allusion
to this wild scheme in the archives of the Dean and Chapter,
to whom the land belonged? In the rector's garden at
Fladbury is the supposed site of the "Vineyards," which in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
the time of Henry III were cultivated there&mdash;(<i>Item percepit
duas paries decimarum terrarum quondam ubi vine&aelig; fuerunt
apud Fladbury</i>: Priory Ledger.) Vines still flourish and
ripen well in that garden. To the south of Astley church,
across the road, lies the "Church-bank," whereon, tradition
says, the monks of Astley Priory were wont to cultivate the
vine; and traces are still visible of terraces whereon probably
the vines were planted. Documents exist relative to vineyards
at Ripple, Leigh, Sedgberrow, and Elmley Castle; and
at Droitwich is a place called "The Vines;" "Vine Hill"
and the "Vineyards," at Doddenham; "The Vinne," "Vinne
Orchard," "Big Vinne," "Little Vinne," and "Great Viney,"
at Abberley; "Vineyard," in Stoke Bliss; "The Vineyard,"
Powick (belonging to St. Martin's parish, and appropriated
to the repairs of the church); "The Vineyard," Lower
Mitton, &amp;c. Some writers have supposed that the Romans
planted vines in Britain. Tacitus intimates that the olive
and the vine were deficient here; but it is clear from Bede
and others that they were cultivated at a subsequent period,
and perhaps were neglected only when the inhabitants found
they could purchase better wines at a low price from France,
or employ their lands to greater advantage by growing corn.
(See also the chapter on Bishop Swinfield's Roll, p. 146.)</p>


<h3>ECHOES.</h3>

<p>Mr. Allies, in his "Antiquities and Folk-lore," mentions a
remarkable echo at the Upper House, Alfrick, which is so
distinct that it will allow about ten syllables to be uttered
before it begins to repeat them. A pointer-dog in the neighbourhood
used to resort to the spot, and bark till he was tired
at his supposed antagonist. Nash records that in the parish
of Bromsgrove were several echoes&mdash;one at the white gate,
between Dyer's bridge and the turnpike; another in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
Crown Close behind High Street; a third at the east and
west corners of the church; a fourth at Woodcot; and a
fifth on the east side of High Street, near the Presbyterian
meeting-house, opposite New Barn. Whether any of these
mocking nymphs have left their cells since the days of Nash,
the writer is unable to say. There is a good echo in the Bath
Road, about two miles from Worcester Cross, and another on
Lansdowne Terrace. In the garden of Chaddesley Corbett
vicarage an echo is produced by the tolling of the great bell
of the church, which, after an interval of two or three seconds,
returns distinctly upon the ear, as though it were the tolling
of the bell of Stone church, which is two miles distant.</p>


<h3>THE LAST FOOL.</h3>

<p>The last country gentleman who kept a fool&mdash;that is, a
professional jester&mdash;in his house, was said to have been Mr.
Bartlett, of Castlemorton. Jack Havod, or Hafod, was the
name of "the squire's fool," and his tricks and drolleries
were remembered by the inhabitants of Castlemorton long
after his death, and are related even in the present day.
It is still a common saying there&mdash;"As big a fool as Jack
Havod;" and it is also told of him that on one occasion he
was assisting in storing peas in a barn, and there being insufficient
room for the crop, Jack very coolly shovelled them out
of a window into a pool of water underneath, saying, "We've
got a vent for them now;" and to this day it is a proverb in
the neighbourhood&mdash;"We've got a vent for them, as Jack
Havod said."</p>


<h3>NOTES ON ELMLEY LOVETT.</h3>

<p>The only doctor of medicine known to have resided in
this parish for the last 200 years was John Aaron, Esq., of
the Moat House, Cutnal Green, who died in 1767, aged 83.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
He was descended from an ancient family of Little Drayton,
near Shiffnal, Salop.&mdash;Dr. Wanley, of Elmley Lodge, who
died in 1776, aged 69, was the only "D.D." that has held
that rectory for the last two centuries.&mdash;Between the river
Salwarpe and Bury-hill Estate, near Droitwich, is some
meadow land belonging to the parish of Elmley Lovett.
This land is more than two miles distant from the nearest
boundary of the parish, and there runs some part of three
other parishes between it, viz., Elmbridge, Hampton, and
Salwarpe. The area of this land is about five acres, and is
the property of Mr. Roberts, and rented by a gentleman at
Droitwich, who pays the rates to Elmley Lovett.</p>


<h3>COUNTY MAGISTRATES' WAGES.</h3>

<p>By a statute as old as the time of Richard II, County
Magistrates were allowed to make a charge of 4s. per day,
and the Clerk of the Peace 2s., as wages for attending
Quarter Sessions. That charge has been regularly made and
allowed by the Sheriff up to the close of last year (1855),
when the ancient statute was repealed by the passing of the
Criminal Justice Act, 18th and 19th Victoria, chap. 126.
In this county these wages were clubbed together as a
dinner and wine fund for the magistrates, but the old
practice is now discontinued, and the magistrates will henceforth
be thrown upon their own resources. In the year
1810 a long and bitter controversy, at one time wearing a
serious aspect, arose among the magistracy of this county,
in consequence of Mr. Welch, the chairman, having
been charged by Mr. Johnson, a fellow magistrate, with
misappropriating a part of these "justice wages" that had
been intrusted to him. The Bench acquitted Mr. Welch.</p>

<h3>ROYAL VISIT TO KING'S NORTON.</h3>

<p>There is a common tradition at King's Norton that Queen
Elizabeth came thither, and was entertained at an ancient
house adjoining the churchyard, probably the residence of
the Manorial Bailiff; but the name of the Queen has perhaps
been mistaken for that of Henrietta Maria, wife of
Charles I, she, according to Dugdale's Diary (p. 52), having
come to King's Norton from Walsall on July 10, 1643.
The manor was part of the Queen's dower.</p>

of Worcester, Hereford, Gloucester, and Coventry and Lichfield,
and of all persons ecclesiastical and temporal as had<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">raised arms or been in active war against the Parliament, or</span><br />
had voluntarily contributed any money, horse, plate, arms,
munition, or other aid or assistance, towards the maintenance
of any forces against the Parliament, should be sequestered.</p>

<p>To this payment Worcestershire does not appear to have
been very heavily charged, as the entire list contains upwards
of 3500 names, extending over the whole of England and
Wales. The largest payment was that made by Baptist Noel
Lord Cambden, which amounted to &pound;9000, "with &pound;150 per
annum settled," which in the case of Sir Richard Tancred,
Knt., is explained to be "settled on the Ministry." The
smallest payment is that of Mr. John Shrimpton above-mentioned.
It is stated in the "Pictorial History of
England" [vol. iii, p. 525] that by these compositions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
above &pound;4,500,000 were raised in England, and &pound;1,000,000
in Ireland.</p>


<h3>A QUADRUPLE ALLIANCE.</h3>

<p>About the year 1823 were born at Bromsgrove four <i>female</i>
children at a birth, all of whom lived for many years. They
were the children of Mr. and Mrs. Robinson, who had five
other children, all single births. The writer of this note saw
them when about three months old, when they were small
for their age. He saw them again when they were about
ten years old. They were then very pretty children, with
dark hair and eyes. Three of them were very much alike,
and exactly of the same height and size. The fourth resembled
the others, but was about half a head shorter.</p>


<h3>A VIRTUOUS PARISH.</h3>

<p>It is a remarkable fact, that from October 2nd, 1842, to
October 23rd, 1848, during which period there were entered
in the parish register of Suckley 106 baptisms, not one illegitimate
birth took place; but this happy state of things did
not continue, for in the next six years, ending October, 1854,
with 89 entries, there were 5 illegitimate births. Thus, during
the last twelve years, the latter have numbered scarcely 1 in
38 of the rising population of Suckley. The average throughout
the kingdom is 1 in 16. It is rather a singular coincidence
that the illegitimate births, and consequently the
illegitimate portion of the community, bear the same proportion
to the general population as the paupers do, viz., 1 in 16.
This remark must, however, be somewhat modified, for
although it cannot be classed amongst <i>statistical facts</i>, it is
probable that there die a larger proportion of illegitimate
than legitimate children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>


<h3>DROITWICH BRINE.</h3>

<p>A correspondent says that the Droitwich brine has for a
considerable time been declining in strength; so much so,
that constant complaints emanate from the working men that
they have considerable difficulty in earning the ordinary
wages of labourers; and the coal which is consumed in
manufacturing a ton of salt is considerably more than was
formerly required. By some of the practical men of the
place this deterioration is attributed to the excessive consumption
of the last few years, and to the immense quantity
that has been wantonly pumped into the river and canal; but
the correspondent suggests the probability of the pits being
insecure, and in consequence the fresh water mingling with
the brine, and thus reducing its natural strength. It has
always been an error (according to his opinion) that shafts
should be sunk down to the brine, as they enlarge the
difficulty of keeping out the water considerably more than
the old-fashioned small bore-holes.</p>


<h3>SMALL PARISHES.</h3>

<p>The smallest parishes in Worcestershire are Oldberrow,
Doverdale, Daylesford, Edvin Loach, Abberton, Bredicot,
and Little Shelsley. The last named place contains the
smallest population, being but 49 in 1851; Bredicot, 67;
Abberton, 80 (although the worthy clerk alone mustered 19
children in his own family); Edvin Loach, 69; Daylesford,
66; Doverdale, 56 (here there are but five houses in the
parish, besides the rectory and mill, and there is no recollection
of any labourer's cottage being in existence); and
Oldberrow, about 50 (here also is no labourer's cottage,
and the only child in the parish is the rector's little boy;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
the parson's surplice fees in eleven years amounted to <i>one
shilling only</i>, and but one interment took place during that
time).</p>


<h3>A CONTRADICTION.</h3>

<p>The parish of Offenham is remarkable for some of the
richest land and one of the poorest churches in the county
of Worcester.</p>


<h3>QUEEN ELIZABETH'S ARREARS.</h3>

<p>A paragraph recently appeared in the London publication,
known as "Notes and Queries," as follows:</p>

<p>"'Good Queen Bess,' when she visited Worcester, borrowed
&pound;200 of the Corporation, which still stands as a 'bad debt' on
the town books."</p>

<p>On the occasion of the Royal visit alluded to, a "fare
cupp" was bought at London "for the presenting the gyfte
to the Queen's Majestie, and xl. pounds in sov'raignes and
angells of her own coign and stamp;" a crimson velvet purse,
with &pound;20 in it, was also presented to the Queen on her
visit to the Cathedral. The total outlay by the city for entertaining
her Majesty was &pound;173. 8s. 4d., but the writer is
not aware of any record of the Queen's having borrowed
&pound;200, or of such an item standing as a "bad debt" on the
books, which he has closely examined from a date prior to
the Queen's visit.</p>


<h3>WORCESTERSHIRE TOKENS&mdash;<span class="smcap">Seventeenth Century</span>.</h3>

<p>Traders' tokens were issued from the year 1648, towards
the close of the reign of Charles I, until the year 1672, when
they were cried down by proclamation of Charles II, and a
new copper currency issued, the first we had in England, all
previously being Royal tokens. During the Commonwealth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
they were not very numerous, but after the Restoration, in
1660, to the year 1672, they are exceedingly abundant, and
were issued in nearly every town and village in England.
They were issued without authority, no doubt, as many of them
state, for necessary change. In London alone nearly 4000
were issued, and the remainder of England are estimated
at 15,000 more. In the year 1669 (when this kind of coinage
was first checked) the citizens of Norwich had a pardon
granted them for all transgressions, and in particular for
their coinage of halfpence and farthings, by which they had
forfeited their charter, all coinage being declared to be the
King's prerogative; and in 1670 the Worcester Corporation
petitioned his Majesty's pardon for "putting out farthings
in this city." The following list of Worcestershire tokens,
recently published by Mr. W. Boyne, in "Aris's Birmingham
Gazette," I now reprint, with a few additions:</p>

<h3>THE CLOTHING TRADE.</h3>

<p>This must have been formerly an important trade in our
county and city. The city of Worcester, and the towns of
Bromsgrove, Kidderminster, Droitwich, and Evesham, were
extensively engaged in it; and when many persons dwelling
in other parts of the county had begun cloth making, much
to the injury of these towns, an act was passed in the 25th
year of Henry VIII, prohibiting all persons from making
cloth, except such as resided in the above-mentioned places,
but all persons were allowed to make cloths for their own
wear, or for their children, servants, &amp;c. At the present
day only one loom is in existence in Bromsgrove, and in
Worcester the trade has ceased for many years, although the
Clothiers' Company still exists as a body for the administration
of charitable funds.</p>


<h3>THE MORTUARY CLOTH OF THE CLOTHIERS'
COMPANY.</h3>

<p>The assumption of Miss Strickland that the mortuary cloth
in the possession of the Clothiers' Company at Worcester was
the pall used at the funeral of Queen Catherine, the first
wife of King Henry VIII, who was buried in Peterborough
Cathedral, has been, upon examination, refuted. At a recent
meeting of the Arch&aelig;ological Institute at Cambridge, the
Rev. C. H. Hartshorne read a paper on the funeral of
Catherine of Arragon, and produced a document from the
Rolls' Court which had never been consulted before, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
which gave a full account of the Queen's funeral. The rev.
gentleman afterwards alluded to the life of Catherine of
Arragon, by Miss Strickland, who says that the pall used
on this occasion is now in the possession of the Clothworkers'
Company at Worcester. Mr. Hartshorne then produced this
pall, which he had been allowed to bring with him. It was
spread out and examined, and it clearly appeared that it
could not be that used at the Queen's funeral. It consisted
of three or four old capes [copes?] put together, and it was
utterly impossible to recognise it from the description given
in the document produced from the Rolls' Court.</p>

<h3>SHIP MONEY.</h3>

<p>The first writ for the levying of ship money was issued by
King Charles I, addressed to the Lord Mayor and citizens of
London. It is dated October 20th, in the 10th year of the
reign of King Charles I [1634], and after reciting that
"certain thieves, pirates, and robbers, of the sea, as well
Turks, enemies of the Christian name, as others, being
gathered together, taking by force and spoiling the ships and
goods and merchandises not only of our subjects, but also of
the subjects of our friends in the sea, which hath been accustomed
anciently to be defended by the English nation, and
the same at their pleasure have carried away, delivering the
men in the same into miserable captivity." The writ commands
the citizens of London to provide seven ships of war,
varying in size from 900 to 300 tons, with 1,460 men, with
ordnance, gunpowder, spears, and weapons, and other necessary
arms for war; and directs that their ships shall be at
Portsmouth on the 1st of March then next. In the year 1636,
King Charles I, by the advice of his Privy Council, sent writs
to the different counties for the raising of money to provide
ships. This was called ship money; but although it was
levied for the nominal purpose of providing ships, the counties,
instead of providing any, paid the amount into the Royal
Exchequer, and this was really a mere device to raise money
without the authority of Parliament.</p>

<p>On the 10th of November, 1639, King Charles I, by the
advice of his Privy Council, caused other writs for ship money
to be issued to the several counties of England; and by one
of these writs the county of Worcester was assessed thus:</p>

<p>But at this time thirty-five of the English counties and seven
of the Welch counties were in arrears for their earlier ship
money, as appears from a table of the arrears, in which there
is the following entry as to Worcestershire:</p>

<p>Ship money was declared to be illegal by the statute 16th
Charles I, chap. 14, which was passed in the year 1640.</p>

<p>For this information we are indebted to John Rushworth,

it will be found (vol. ii, pp. 257, 335, 975, 978.)</p>


<h3>FINES FOR NOT TAKING THE ORDER OF
KNIGHTHOOD.</h3>

<p>Mr. Rushworth, Secretary to the Lord General Fairfax, in
his Historical Collections, vol. ii, p. 71, under the date of July
6, 1630, says that "the King having sent writs to several
sheriffs of the several counties for the summoning of all that
had forty pound land or rent by the year to appear at the
day of the Coronation and prepare themselves to receive the
Order of Knighthood," did award a Commission to certain
Lords and others of his Privy Council to treat and compound
with all those who had made default. This was founded on
the Statute De Militibus, a statute stated by the Record Commissioners
to be of uncertain date, but which is usually printed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
as of the first year of the reign of King Edward II. By the
statute 16th of Charles I, chap. 20, compulsory Knighthood
is abolished. The following is a list of Worcester gentlemen
fined by King Charles I for not taking the order of Knighthood;
it is extracted from the "Book of Compositions for
not taking the Order of Knighthood at the Coronation of
King Charles I. 1630-1632. Auditor of the Receipt<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>."</p>

<h3>SLAUGHTER OF DOGS AND CATS.</h3>

<p>The onslaught made on dogs found in the streets of Worcester,
when the cholera was expected three or four years
ago, suggests an extract from history bearing on the point.
In the Droitwich records, the bailiff's accounts for the year
1637, a time of great pestilence, contain the following among
other entries:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="bailiff's accounts">

<p>In the parochial records of the city of Westminster for
the year 1603 mention is made of one person having "massacred
the amazing number of 500 dogs;" and in 1605, 83<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
others. Thus it seemed the practice of making a hecatomb
of dogs and cats on these sad occasions. Can any one
explain the reason of this? Was it that these animals
were deemed to be peculiarly obnoxious to the pestilence,
and that it was contagious? Similar practices prevailed in
ancient times: we read in the "Iliad"&mdash;</p>

<h3>TRACES OF THE STUARTS IN WORCESTERSHIRE.</h3>

<p>The following notes contain a few historical facts, either
not fully related, or omitted altogether in the local histories,
relative to the progresses of Charles I and his son through
this county during the Civil Wars:</p>

<p>The unhappy contest between King Charles and his people
first brought that Sovereign into Worcestershire in the year
1644, when he fled from Essex and Waller at Oxford. The
city of Worcester presented his Majesty with &pound;200 and the
Princes Rupert and Maurice &pound;100 each, the purse for his
majesty costing 8d. (as recorded in the Corporation books),
and those for the Princes 4d. each. An order had been issued
to raise &pound;1000 (equal to &pound;15,000 of the present time) in less
than two days, and the above sums were probably all that could
be extracted out of the half-ruined inhabitants at that time.
His Majesty retreating with his army to Bewdley, two guides
for the royal carriage were engaged at a cost of 4s. 6d., and
six axletrees (articles frequently requiring renewal in those
days of un-M'Adam-ized roads) were charged 4s. At Bewdley,
Charles wrote a letter from Tickenhill Palace to Prince
Rupert, urging him to relieve York. This led to the battle
of Marston Moor. The letter is given in the appendix to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
Guizot's History of the English Revolution. About the same
time a Royal missive was addressed to the Corporation and
inhabitants of Droitwich, thanking them for the assistance
they had sent into Worcester when Waller assaulted it.
While at Bewdley also the King dispatched a party of horse
to relieve Dudley Castle, which was then besieged by the Earl
of Denbigh, but they were defeated with considerable loss.
Waller having now outflanked the King, his Majesty returned
suddenly to Worcester, and hastened through Evesham to
join the remainder of his forces at Oxford. At Evesham, he
took the Mayor and certain Aldermen prisoners and carried
them to Oxford; but the Royalists were closely pursued by
the forces of the Parliament under Waller, and were obliged
to break down the bridges behind them to make good their
retreat. The Royalists also burned down many houses in
the suburbs of Worcester, the better to secure the city.
Between Evesham and Oxford are several memorials of his
Majesty's misfortunes. In a bed-room at the White Hart
inn, at Moreton-in-the-Marsh, appears the following:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When friends were few, and dangers near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">King Charles found rest and safety here.<br /></span>
<span class="i10">KING CHARLES I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">slept at this inn on his way to Evesham,<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Tuesday, July 2, 1644."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In August, 1644, offers were made to the Parliament by divers
gentlemen of Worcestershire to raise forces for their service,
and an ordinance was passed for that purpose. At the
beginning of 1645 the King appointed Prince Maurice, his
nephew and son of the Elector Palatine of the Rhine, "General
of Worcester, Hereford, and Shropshire." It is apparent,
from other records besides those of the corporation, that his
brother, Prince Rupert, was also, at short intervals of inaction
in the field, present at Worcester, and there is sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
evidence to show that these arrogant, fiery, and remorseless
soldiers of fortune bled the city more copiously than Dr.
Sangrado did his patients. Here is an extract from a warrant
of Prince Rupert's, which will exhibit his peremptory tone
and fierce character, and afford some idea of the horrors of
civil war. It commands labourers and provisions to be sent
to him "upon your utmost peril, as the total burning and
plundering of your houses, with what other mischief the
licensed and hungry soldiers can inflict upon you." Early
in 1645, the "clubmen," as they were called, appeared in
large bodies in Worcestershire, assumed a defensive attitude,
and refused to serve the King according to his proclamation.
These clubmen first arose in the west of England, where for a
time their efforts were principally directed to the checking of
the cruelties and licentious outrages of Goring, the Royalist
commander, and his desperate bands. Gradually gentlemen
of rank and substance joined the yeomen and peasantry, and
gave a new direction to the association. The original motive
of the "clubmen" was sufficiently explained in the motto on
one of their ensigns or standards&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If ye offer to plunder or take our cattle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be you assured we'll give you battle."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Worcestershire clubmen first mustered to the number
of about two thousand, and put forth a declaration of their
intentions against the Popish party and to preserve the
King's rights and the privileges of Parliament. They rapidly
increased in force; Prince Rupert strove to pacify them, but
in vain; the constables refused to bring in a list of the names
of those who thus assembled. By the middle of March their
number had increased to fourteen thousand well armed men,
and they applied to Colonel Massey, then in command at
Gloucester, for assistance to enable them to besiege Hereford.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
Massey replied that if they would fully declare for the Parliament
he would join with them. They requested two or three
days for consideration, but their answer is not recorded that I
am aware of. It is probable, however, that they did declare,
either at this period or a little later, for the Parliament.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the 11th of May, 1645, the King and his
forces were at Inkberrow, at the vicarage of which place
I have seen an old book of maps, said to have been left
behind him by the King when he slept there. The title
page is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Kingdome of England and Principality of Wales, exactly
described with every sheere and the small townes in every one of
them, on six mappes portable for every man's pocket; useful for
all commanders for quarteringe of souldiers, and all sorts of persons
that would be informed where the armies be&mdash;never so commodiously
drawne before this 1644. Described by one that travailed
throughout the whole Kingdome for its purpose."</p></div>

<p>Thorn farmhouse, at Inkberrow, also claims the honour
of having sheltered the royal head; and there is a farmhouse
at Cookhill, in the same parish, in which a portrait
of the King remained hidden behind a sliding panel (probably
ever since the days of the Commonwealth), and would not
have been discovered to the present time but for the decay
of a peg on which it was hung, occasioning it to fall with
a great noise in the night time some years ago. So large
a number of old houses in this county are said to have been
temporary resting places for the King or his fugitive son
that it is probable one half of these traditions cannot be
correct. The King marched from Inkberrow to Droitwich,
where he stayed from Sunday till Wednesday, and then
went to the siege of Hawkesley House, which was at once
surrendered, and set on fire. That night the King lay at
Cofton Hall, near Bromsgrove, occupied by Mr. Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
Jolliffe, who was faithful to his Sovereign to the last, and
attended his execution. There is a tradition that when the
King was in prison he gave a key to Mr. Jolliffe, to visit
him when he pleased; and in Dr. Nash's time there was
a picture in the house, representing that gentleman, with a
key in his hand, his pistols and sword hanging on a pillar
before him. After leaving Cofton Hall the King marched
to Himley, then inhabited by Lord Ward.</p>

<p>In June, 1645, was fought the famous battle of Naseby,
which crushed the Royal cause. Soon afterwards, the Scotch
army was ordered to march from Nottingham to Worcester;
and in July, Canon Froome, in Herefordshire, then a garrison
of the King's, was taken by the Scotch army with little
loss, and Col. Harley, progenitor of the famous Tory minister
of Queen Anne and of the Earls of Oxford and Mortimer,
was appointed governor of the place. Whether the property
at Canon Froome then belonged, as it does now, to a member
of the ancient family of Hopton, I have not the means of
ascertaining, but it is recorded in the memorials of Whitelock
that about this time a Mr. Hopton, with a small band of
followers, fell in with, and, after a gallant conflict, destroyed
a party of the Royalists in the vicinity of Ledbury.</p>

<p>In August, 1645, the King came with his army from
Shipston-on-Stour to Worcester, where they rested several
days, the guards lying at Claines. The Worcester Corporation
accounts of this period contain numerous items of
expense incurred by "the Scots' king," as his Majesty was
then somewhat contemptuously termed; and the chamberlains
also "pray to be allowed for butter potts and napkins, bottles,
&amp;c., sent to the Denary (his Majesty's quarters) and there
lost."</p>

<p>Charles again passed through Bewdley, where a skirmish
took place with his pursuers, and sixty Royalists were taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
prisoners. It is said that he slept for two nights at the Angel
Inn, in that town, and that the inhabitants granted the sum
of half-a-crown for his entertainment, but there is probably
some mistake either in the amount or in the alleged object
to which it was applied. Tickenhill Palace was so much
damaged during these wars that it was taken down soon
afterwards. From Bewdley the King went to Bromyard,
and at length the hunted monarch found shelter in the
princely halls of Ragland with the Marquis of Worcester.
It is recorded that in November of this year divers persons
of Worcestershire, under Mr. Dingley&mdash;he was an officer
who had served in the Low Countries&mdash;declared for the
Parliament and complained of the "insolence and injuries"
of the garrison of Worcester. Probably the clubmen now
gave in their adhesion to the only party which was able to
protect them, and against which resistance would have been
unavailing, for the fortunes of King Charles were rapidly
sinking to the lowest ebb. In proof of these "insolences
and injuries" a copy of a warrant from Col. Bard (probably
Baird), the governor, to the constables who were accustomed
to collect the contributions, was laid before the Parliament.
It was drawn after the most approved Rupert style:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Know that unless you bring into me (at a day and house in
Worcester) the monthly contribution for six months, you are to
expect an unsanctified troop of horse among you, from whom, if
you hide yourselves, they shall fire your houses without mercy, hang
up your bodies wherever they find them, and scare your ghosts, &amp;c."</p></div>

<p>This probably led to the organisation of the Worcestershire
Committee of defence and safety, of which mention first
occurs immediately after the declaration of Mr. Dingley and
others and the representation made by them to the Parliament.
Early in December, 1645, Prince Rupert and Prince
Maurice set out from Worcester with 160 horse in the direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
of Oxford. They were obstructed on their march by a party
of the "clubmen" under Sir Edward Dingley, the then head
of this old Worcestershire family. But these raw levies were
no match for the trained cavaliers and their ardent leaders.
The Princes and their troop cut their way through Dingley's
yeomen, killing and wounding several of them, and so got
safely to Oxford.</p>

<p>The unfortunate upholder of "divine right in kings" passed
to his account in January, 1649. In 1651, Charles II escaped
with his forces out of Scotland, and marching through the
northern and midland counties, entered Worcester on the
23rd of August. Major-Generals Lambert and Harrison
had despatched some forces to secure the place, lest the King
should make it a quarter or garrison. These and the country
levies made a brave resistance and beat back the Royalists
several times, but the townsmen having laid down their
arms, and some of them shooting at the Parliament soldiers
out of the windows, they removed their ammunition, while
a party of only thirty men kept the enemy at bay. They
then retired in good order upon Gloucester, the King's troops
being too much fatigued by their long marches from the north
to pursue them. Charles was proclaimed King in this city.
The result of the disastrous battle of Worcester has been
already described by various historians. William Bagnall,
then living in Sidbury, being one of the "Chamber," or Corporation,
turned out a horse, ready bridled and saddled, for
the use of his Majesty, when the latter was so near being
captured. Mr. Bagnall died in a year afterwards, but the
family would never afterwards receive any consideration for
the horse or saddle. In Chambers's "Biographical Illustrations"
it is stated that "Sir Charles Wogan is said to have
been robbed of the honour of saving King Charles II after
the battle of Worcester, as he stopped those who were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
chase of his Majesty and Colonel Carless." At Wolverley,
in the dell upon the brink of which Lea Castle stands, is still
shown the spot over which the King crossed on his way to
Kinfare and Boscobel.</p>

<p>On the Bromyard road, some three miles and a half from
the city of Worcester (says a writer in the publication called
"Notes and Queries"), is Cotheridge Court, the manorial
residence of the Berkeleys. The Mr. Berkeley who held it
at the date of the battle of Worcester was a stout Royalist,
and went to help the fallen fortunes of his King. It so
chanced that he had two piebald horses, who were exactly
like each other, "specially Sambo," as the niggers say. He
made one of these horses his charger, and rode him to the
fight. When Cromwell had gained his "crowning merits,"
Mr. Berkeley escaped to Cotheridge as best he might; and
planning a very skilful ruse, left his exhausted charger at
one of the farmhouses not far from the court. He then
betook himself to bed, and, as he had foreseen, a troop of
crop-headed Parliamentarists now made their appearance
before his doors and sought admittance. Mr. Berkeley was
ill in bed, and could not be seen. Fudge! they must see him.
So they go to his bed-side. "So you were fighting against us
at Worcester to-day, were you?" say the crop-heads. "Me!"
says Mr. Berkeley, faintly and innocently; "why, I am sick,
and forced to keep my bed." "All very fine," say the crop-heads,
"but you were there, my dear sir, for you rode a
piebald charger, and were very conspicuous." "It could not
have been me," says the sick man, "for though I certainly do
ride a piebald charger when I am in health, yet he has never
been out of the stable all day. If you doubt my word, you had
better go to the stable and satisfy yourselves." So the crop-heads
go to the stable, and there, of course, find piebald
No. 2, as fresh as a daisy, and evidently not from Worcester.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
So they conclude that they had mistaken their man, and leave
the sick Mr. Berkeley to get well and laugh at the ruse he
had so successfully played upon them.</p>

<p>After his flight from Worcester and concealment at White
Ladies, the King appeared as "Will Jones," attired in a
leather doublet, with pewter buttons, a pair of old green
breeches, a green "jump coat," a pair of stockings with the
tops cut off, a pair of stirrup stockings, a pair of shoes cut
and slashed to give ease to his feet, an old grey greasy hat
without a lining, a "noggen shirt" of the coarsest linen, his
hands and face made of a "reechy complexion" with the aid
of walnut leaves. He attempted to reach Wales, but got no
further than Madeley, being obliged to return, as there were
no means of crossing the Severn, without danger. He
returned to his shelter in Staffordshire, and quitted his suit
for a new grey one, as the holiday attire of a farmer's son,
and thus as "Will Jackson" he rode before Mrs. Jane Lane,
and ultimately effected his escape.</p>

<p>In Martley church is still, I believe, an inscription to
Lettice Lane, sister to the above Mrs. Jane Lane, who rode
with Charles II, disguised as her servant, on his retreat to
the south-west coast. On the floor of the old church of
Knightwick (recently closed) was also a plain stone to Grace
Lane, another of the same family. It is said that his Majesty
halted at Knightwick, and was glad to turn shoeblack at the
Talbot inn, to avoid the suspicion of pursuers. Colonel Lane,
of Bentley, Staffordshire, had property at Knightwick, and
the young lady, with her royal master, probably rested here
on that account. The gold pouncet box given by the King
to Mrs. Jane Lane during their journey from Bentley to
Bristol, after the battle of Worcester, and a beautiful portrait
(a miniature) of Colonel Lane, were exhibited by Miss Yonge,
at the Arch&aelig;ological Institute Meeting at Shrewsbury, October,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
1855. On the former are engraved, on a lozenge, the arms of
the Lane family, with the canton of England granted as an
honourable augmentation. These interesting relics were in
the possession of Dr. Arden, who married a lady of the Lane
family, and they were presented by Miss Arden to their
present possessor. In "Colston's Life and Times" is the
following interesting allusion to the progress of the royal
fugitive:&mdash;"At the close of the year, the vessel which conveyed
the body of the Lord-Deputy Ireton, who had died of
the plague, at Limerick, came into King Road, 'notice of
which having been forwarded to the Mayor of Bristol, he
sent a boat, covered with black, in which the corpse was
brought to the city. When the body was landed, a velvet
pall was placed over the coffin, and the Mayor, Aldermen, and
Common Council, in their formalities, and the Governor and
his officers, with a multitude of citizens, attended the body.
On this occasion the great guns were fired from the castle and
fort.' Nearly coincident with the above, a horseman, with
apparently his mistress seated behind him, on a pillion,
entered Bristol at Lawford's Gate. He was unknown, unnoticed;
but between him, and the ashes that with gloomy
solemnity were paraded, there was a connecting link&mdash;connecting
yet repulsive. They were the ashes of a fallen foe,
the mortal remains of an enemy&mdash;of one who had sentenced
to a traitor's doom the august sire of the menial who now
journeyed through a city, whose allegiance to him and his
cause had been severed, where there awaited a thousand
arms to deliver him to captivity, perhaps to death. The
place is evidently familiar to the rider. He made no inquiries,
but conducted his horse unheeded through the streets.
He arrives in view of the lofty bulwarks of the castle, its
towers and gigantic keep. Their sight may have called forth
latent memories, for here the horse was stayed, turned aside,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
as though the travellers would take a passing survey of the
stately pile; but this was all; they halted not to rest at inn
or hostelry, nor dismounted to refresh the steed, but quietly
and leisurely continued their course, through a narrow gloomy
street, over the bridge, and thus in safety passed from out
the ancient town, unsuspected, unchallenged, and unknown.
How strange are life's vicissitudes, its contrasts! A king,
disguised&mdash;passing obscurely through a half hostile city!
The mortal remains of the son-in-law of the usurper of his
kingdom received with military honours and Royal etiquette.
In one quarter, pomp and state following the ashes, as would
befit a monarch's obsequies; in another, a deserted crownless
sovereign, in lowly garb, eludes the pursuit of his enemy, and
passes in safety to a less doubtful shelter from the city, of
which he was the lawful lord. In after years, all this quaint
and gorgeous pomp will be displayed to welcome this fugitive,
and he will be escorted triumphantly through its lately hostile
bosom."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In reference to the Civil Wars in this county, the following
extracts from Dugdale's Diary will be found to possess some
interest:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"March 22, 1644. This night, &mdash;&mdash; brother to Fox ye tinker
(wch. keeps a garrison of rebells in Edgbaston House, com. Warr.)
entred Sturton Castle, com. Stafford, with 200 men from &mdash;&mdash;
to plant a garrison there.</p>

<p>"May 3 [1644].&mdash;Sr. Tho. Littleton, of Frankley, com. Wigorn,
taken prisoner by a p'ty of horse (sent by Fox, the tinker from
Edgbaston) to Ticknall Mannor near Beaudley."</p></div>

<p>John Fox "the Tinker," as he is here and before called,
and "that rogue Fox" as the Royalists sometimes term him,
appears to have been a very active officer, and no small
annoyance to his adversaries. Amongst the papers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
republican Earl of Denbigh, who was commander in chief
of the forces in the counties of Warwick, Worcester, Stafford,
and Salop, is a memorandum, made about March, 1643-4,
of a commission granted to John Fox to be colonel of a
regiment to consist of six troops of horse and two companies
of dragoons, and a commission to Reynold Fox to be his
major. The same collection (which is arranged in two large
folio volumes) contains several letters from Fox, during his
occupation of Edgbaston House, where nothing but the
enthusiasm of party could have kept his ill-clothed and ill-paid
soldiers together. Indeed, at one time, he confesses
that he durst not leave them to wait upon his Lordship, "for
feare of mutunyes and a <i>general departure</i>." Fox signs
in an illiterate manner, and his letters are always in the
writing of another hand, probably that of a German, as he
mentions "Hampton, Brewood, and the Dorpes [villages]
thereabouts." By referring to October 5, following, it will
be found that the united forces from Worcester and Dudley
Castle were not able to unkennel him in his little garrison
at Edgbaston, but "returned without doing anything;" or&mdash;as
Fox would probably have said&mdash;were repulsed with loss.
Odious enough in the eyes of the Cavaliers, for his successful
opposition, he was surcharged with being one of King
Charles's executioners: "Some have a conceit that he that
gave the stroke was one Collonell Foxe, and the other
Captain Joyce, who took the King from Holmby, but that
is not believed."&mdash;Journal of the Earl of Leicester, in
Sydney Papers, by Blencowe, p. 61.</p>

<p>"October 5.&mdash;Forces went out of Worcester and joyned
with others from Dudley Castle to recover Edgbaston House
from ye Rebells. Returned without doing anything."</p>
